# Parsing Strings in .NET
A parsing operation converts a string that represents a .NET base type into that base type. For example, a parsing operation is used to convert a string to a floating-point number or to a date and time value. The method most commonly used to perform a parsing operation is the `Parse` method. Because parsing is the reverse operation of formatting (which involves converting a base type into its string representation), many of the same rules and conventions apply. Just as formatting uses an object that implements the <xref:System.IFormatProvider> interface to provide culture-sensitive formatting information, parsing also uses an object that implements the <xref:System.IFormatProvider> interface to determine how to interpret a string representation. For more information, see [Formatting Types](../../../docs/standard/base-types/formatting-types.md).
