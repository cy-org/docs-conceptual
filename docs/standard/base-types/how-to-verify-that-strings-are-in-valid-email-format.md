# How to: Verify that Strings Are in Valid Email Format
The following example uses a regular expression to verify that a string is in valid email format.  
  
## Example  
 The example defines an `IsValidEmail` method, which returns `true` if the string contains a valid email address and `false` if it does not, but takes no other action.  
  
 To verify that the email address is valid, the `IsValidEmail` method calls the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%28System.String%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchEvaluator%29?displayProperty=fullName> method with the `(@)(.+)$` regular expression pattern to separate the domain name from the email address. The third parameter is a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchEvaluator> delegate that represents the method that processes and replaces the matched text. The regular expression pattern is interpreted as follows.  
  
|Pattern|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|`(@)`|Match the @ character. This is the first capturing group.|  
|`(.+)`|Match one or more occurrences of any character. This is the second capturing group.|  
|`$`|End the match at the end of the string.|  
  
 The domain name along with the @ character is passed to the `DomainMapper` method, which uses the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping> class to translate Unicode characters that are outside the US-ASCII character range to Punycode. The method also sets the `invalid` flag to `True` if the <xref:System.Globalization.IdnMapping.GetAscii%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method detects any invalid characters in the domain name. The method returns the Punycode domain name preceded by the @ symbol to the `IsValidEmail` method.  
  
 The `IsValidEmail` method then calls the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%28System.String%2CSystem.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to verify that the address conforms to a regular expression pattern.  
  
 Note that the `IsValidEmail` method does not perform authentication to validate the email address. It merely determines whether its format is valid for an email address. In addition, the `IsValidEmail` method does not verify that the top-level domain name is a valid domain name listed at the [IANA Root Zone Database](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db), which would require a look-up operation. Instead, the regular expression merely verifies that the top-level domain name consists of between two and twenty-four ASCII characters, with alphanumeric first and last characters and the remaining characters being either alphanumeric or a hyphen (-).  
  
 [!code-csharp[RegularExpressions.Examples.Email#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/RegularExpressions.Examples.Email/cs/example4.cs#7)]
 [!code-vb[RegularExpressions.Examples.Email#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/RegularExpressions.Examples.Email/vb/example4.vb#7)]  
  
 In this example, the regular expression pattern ``^(?(")(".+?(?<!\\)"@)|(([0-9a-z]((\.(?!\.))|[-!#\$%&'\*\+/=\?\^`{}|~\w])*)(?<=[0-9a-z])@))(?([)([(\d{1,3}.){3}\d{1,3}])|(([0-9a-z][-\w]*[0-9a-z]*.)+[a-z0-9][-a-z0-9]{0,22}[a-z0-9]))$`` is interpreted as shown in the following table. Note that the regular expression is compiled using the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions.IgnoreCase?displayProperty=fullName> flag.  
  
|Pattern|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|`^`|Begin the match at the start of the string.|  
|`(?(")`|Determine whether the first character is a quotation mark. `(?(")` is the beginning of an alternation construct.|  
|`(?("")("".+?(?<!\\)""@)`|If the first character is a quotation mark, match a beginning quotation mark followed by at least one occurrence of any character, followed by an ending quotation mark. The ending quotation mark must not be preceded by a backslash character (\\). `(?<!` is the beginning of a zero-width negative lookbehind assertion. The string should conclude with an at sign (@).|  
|`&#124;(([0-9a-z]`|If the first character is not a quotation mark, match any alphabetic character from a to z or A to Z (the comparison is case insensitive), or any numeric character from 0 to 9.|  
|`(\.(?!\.))`|If the next character is a period, match it. If it is not a period, look ahead to the next character and continue the match. `(?!\.)` is a zero-width negative lookahead assertion that prevents two consecutive periods from appearing in the local part of an email address.|  
|``&#124;[-!#\$%&'\*\+/=\?\^`{}\&#124;~\w]``|If the next character is not a period, match any word character or one of the following characters: -!#$%'*+=?^`{}&#124;~.|  
|``((\.(?!\.))&#124;[-!#\$%'\*\+/=\?\^`{}\&#124;~\w])*``|Match the alternation pattern (a period followed by a non-period, or one of a number of characters) zero or more times.|  
|`@`|Match the @ character.|  
|`(?<=[0-9a-z])`|Continue the match if the character that precedes the @ character is A through Z, a through z, or 0 through 9. The `(?<=[0-9a-z])` construct defines a zero-width positive lookbehind assertion.|  
|`(?(\[)`|Check whether the character that follows @ is an opening bracket.|  
|`(\[(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\])`|If it is an opening bracket, match the opening bracket followed by an IP address (four sets of one to three digits, with each set separated by a period) and a closing bracket.|  
|`&#124;(([0-9a-z][-\w]*[0-9a-z]*\.)+`|If the character that follows @ is not an opening bracket, match one alphanumeric character with a value of A-Z, a-z, or 0-9, followed by zero or more occurrences of a word character or a hyphen, followed by zero or one alphanumeric character with a value of A-Z, a-z, or 0-9, followed by a period. This pattern can be repeated one or more times, and must be followed by the top-level domain name.|  
|`[a-z0-9][\-a-z0-9]{0,22}[a-z0-9]))`|The top-level domain name must begin and end with an alphanumeric character (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9). It can also include from zero to 22 ASCII characters that are either alphanumeric or hyphens.|  
|`$`|End the match at the end of the string.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Instead of using a regular expression to validate an email address, you can use the <xref:System.Net.Mail.MailAddress?displayProperty=fullName> class. To determine whether an email address is valid, pass the email address to the <xref:System.Net.Mail.MailAddress.%23ctor%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> class constructor.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 The `IsValidEmail` and `DomainMapper` methods can be included in a library of regular expression utility methods, or they can be included as private static or instance methods in the application class.  
  
 To include them in a regular expression library, either copy and paste the code into a Visual Studio Class Library project, or copy and paste it into a text file and compile it from the command line with a command like the following (assuming that the name of the source code file is RegexUtilities.cs or RegexUtilities.vb:  
  
```csharp  
csc /t:library RegexUtilities.cs  
```  
  
```vb  
vbc /t:library RegexUtilities.vb  
```  
  
 You can also use the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.CompileToAssembly%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to include this regular expression in a regular expression library.  
  
 If they are used in a regular expression library, you can call them by using code such as the following:  
  
 [!code-csharp[RegularExpressions.Examples.Email#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/RegularExpressions.Examples.Email/cs/example4.cs#8)]
 [!code-vb[RegularExpressions.Examples.Email#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/RegularExpressions.Examples.Email/vb/example4.vb#8)]  
  
 Assuming you've created a class library named RegexUtilities.dll that includes your email validation regular expression, you can compile this example in either of the following ways:  
  
-   In Visual Studio, by creating a Console Application and adding a reference to RegexUtilities.dll to your project.  
  
-   From the command line, by copying and pasting the source code into a text file and compiling it with a command like the following (assuming that the name of the source code file is Example.cs or Example.vb:  
  
    ```csharp  
    csc Example.cs /r:RegexUtilities.dll  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    vbc Example.vb /r:RegexUtilities.dll  
    ```
