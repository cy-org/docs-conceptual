# Timers
Timers are lightweight objects that enable you to specify a delegate to be called at a specified time. A thread in the thread pool performs the wait operation.  
  
 Using the <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class is straightforward. You create a **Timer**, passing a <xref:System.Threading.TimerCallback> delegate to the callback method, an object representing state that will be passed to the callback, an initial raise time, and a time representing the period between callback invocations. To cancel a pending timer, call the **Timer.Dispose** function.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  There are two other timer classes. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class is a control that works with visual designers and is meant to be used in user interface contexts; it raises events on the user interface thread. The <xref:System.Timers.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class derives from <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component>, so it can be used with visual designers; it also raises events, but it raises them on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread. The <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class makes callbacks on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread and does not use the event model at all. It also provides a state object to the callback method, which the other timers do not. It is extremely lightweight.  
  
 The following code example starts a timer that starts after one second (1000 milliseconds) and ticks every second until you press the **Enter** key. The variable containing the reference to the timer is a class-level field, to ensure that the timer is not subject to garbage collection while it is still running. For more information on aggressive garbage collection, see <xref:System.GC.KeepAlive%2A>.
