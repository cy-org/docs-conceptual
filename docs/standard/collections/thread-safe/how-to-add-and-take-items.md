# How to: Add and Take Items Individually from a BlockingCollection
This example shows how to add and remove items from a <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601> in both a blocking and non-blocking manner. For more information on <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601>, see [BlockingCollection Overview](../../../../docs/standard/collections/thread-safe/blockingcollection-overview.md).  
  
 For an example of how to enumerate a <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601> until it is empty and no more elements will be added, see [How to: Use ForEach to Remove Items in a BlockingCollection](../../../../docs/standard/collections/thread-safe/how-to-use-foreach-to-remove.md)  
  
## Example  
 This first example shows how to add and take items so that the operations will block if the collection is either temporarily empty (when taking) or at maximum capacity (when adding), or a specified timeout period has elapsed. Note that blocking on maximum capacity is only enabled when the BlockingCollection has been created with a maximum capacity specified in the constructor.

## Example  
 This second example shows how to add and take items so that the operations will not block. If no item is present, or maximum capacity on a bounded collection has been reached, or the timeout period has elapsed, then the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryAdd%2A> or <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryTake%2A> operation returns false. This allows the thread to do some other useful work for awhile and then try again later to either retrieve a new item, or try to add the same item that could not be added previously. The program also demonstrates how to implement cancellation when accessing a <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601>.
