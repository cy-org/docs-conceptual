# Commonly Used Collection Types
Collection types are the common variations of data collections, such as hash tables, queues, stacks, bags, dictionaries, and lists.  
  
 Collections are based on the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> interface, the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface, the <xref:System.Collections.IDictionary> interface, or their generic counterparts. The <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface and the <xref:System.Collections.IDictionary> interface are both derived from the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> interface; therefore, all collections are based on the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> interface either directly or indirectly. In collections based on the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface (such as <xref:System.Array>, <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601>) or directly on the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> interface (such as <xref:System.Collections.Queue>, <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue%601>, <xref:System.Collections.Stack>, <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentStack%601> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.LinkedList%601>), every element contains only a value. In collections based on the <xref:System.Collections.IDictionary> interface (such as the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> and <xref:System.Collections.SortedList> classes, the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.SortedList%602> generic classes), or the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary%602> classes, every element contains both a key and a value.  The <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> class is unique because it is a list of values with keys embedded within the values and, therefore, it behaves like a list and like a dictionary.  
  
 Generic collections are the best solution to strong typing. However, if your language does not support generics, the <xref:System.Collections> namespace includes base collections, such as <xref:System.Collections.CollectionBase>, <xref:System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase>, and <xref:System.Collections.DictionaryBase>, which are abstract base classes that can be extended to create collection classes that are strongly typed. When efficient multi-threaded collection access is required, use the generic collections in the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent> namespace.  
  
 Collections can vary, depending on how the elements are stored, how they are sorted, how searches are performed, and how comparisons are made. The <xref:System.Collections.Queue> class and the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Queue%601> generic class provide first-in-first-out lists, while the <xref:System.Collections.Stack> class and the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Stack%601> generic class provide last-in-first-out lists. The <xref:System.Collections.SortedList> class and the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.SortedList%602> generic class provide sorted versions of the <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> class and the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> generic class. The elements of a <xref:System.Collections.Hashtable> or a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602> are accessible only by the key of the element, but the elements of a <xref:System.Collections.SortedList> or a <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.KeyedCollection%602> are accessible either by the key or by the index of the element. The indexes in all collections are zero-based, except <xref:System.Array>, which allows arrays that are not zero-based.  
  
 The LINQ to Objects feature allows you to use LINQ queries to access in-memory objects as long as the object type implements <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>. LINQ queries provide a common pattern for accessing data; are typically more concise and readable than standard `foreach` loops; and provide filtering, ordering and grouping capabilities. LINQ queries can also improve performance. For more information, see [LINQ to Objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/73cafe73-37cf-46e7-bfa7-97c7eea7ced9) and [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq.md).
