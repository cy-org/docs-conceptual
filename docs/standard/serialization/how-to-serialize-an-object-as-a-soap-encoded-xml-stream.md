# How to: Serialize an Object as a SOAP-Encoded XML Stream
  
 Because a SOAP message is built using XML, the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class can be used to serialize classes and generate encoded SOAP messages. The resulting XML conforms to [section 5 of the World Wide Web Consortium document "Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 1.1"](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383512). When you are creating an XML Web service that communicates through SOAP messages, you can customize the XML stream by applying a set of special SOAP attributes to classes and members of classes. For a list of attributes, see [Attributes That Control Encoded SOAP Serialization](../../../docs/standard/serialization/attributes-that-control-encoded-soap-serialization.md).  
  
### To serialize an object as a SOAP-encoded XML stream  
  
1.  Create the class using the [XML Schema Definition Tool (Xsd.exe)](../../../docs/standard/serialization/xml-schema-definition-tool-xsd-exe.md).  
  
2.  Apply one or more of the special attributes found in `System.Xml.Serialization`. See the list in "Attributes That Control Encoded SOAP Serialization."  
  
3.  Create an `XmlTypeMapping` by creating a new `SoapReflectionImporter`, and invoking the `ImportTypeMapping` method with the type of the serialized class.  
  
     The following code example calls the `ImportTypeMapping` method of the `SoapReflectionImporter` class to create an `XmlTypeMapping`.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' Serializes a class named Group as a SOAP message.  
    Dim myTypeMapping As XmlTypeMapping =
        New SoapReflectionImporter().ImportTypeMapping(GetType(Group))  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // Serializes a class named Group as a SOAP message.  
    XmlTypeMapping myTypeMapping =
        new SoapReflectionImporter().ImportTypeMapping(typeof(Group));
    ```  
  
4.  Create an instance of the `XmlSerializer` class by passing the `XmlTypeMapping` to the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.%23ctor%28System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeMapping%29> constructor.  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim mySerializer As XmlSerializer = New XmlSerializer(myTypeMapping)  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    XmlSerializer mySerializer = new XmlSerializer(myTypeMapping);  
    ```  
  
5.  Call the `Serialize` or `Deserialize` method.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
' Serializes a class named Group as a SOAP message.  
Dim myTypeMapping As XmlTypeMapping =
    New SoapReflectionImporter().ImportTypeMapping(GetType(Group))
Dim mySerializer As XmlSerializer = New XmlSerializer(myTypeMapping)  
```  
  
```csharp  
// Serializes a class named Group as a SOAP message.  
XmlTypeMapping myTypeMapping =
    new SoapReflectionImporter().ImportTypeMapping(typeof(Group));
XmlSerializer mySerializer = new XmlSerializer(myTypeMapping);  
```
