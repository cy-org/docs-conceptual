# Steps in the serialization process
When the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatter.Serialize*> method is called on a [formatter](xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatter), object serialization proceeds according to the following sequence of rules:

- A check is made to determine whether the formatter has a surrogate selector. If the formatter does, check whether the surrogate selector handles objects of the given type. If the selector handles the object type, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable.GetObjectData*?displayProperty=fullName> is called on the surrogate selector.

- If there is no surrogate selector or if it does not handle the object type, a check is made to determine whether the object is marked with the [Serializable](xref:System.SerializableAttribute) attribute. If the object is not, a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException> is thrown.

- If the object is marked appropriately, check whether the object implements the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface. If the object does, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable.GetObjectData*> is called on the object.
  
- If the object does not implement <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable>, the default serialization policy is used, serializing all fields not marked as [NonSerialized](xref:System.NonSerializedAttribute).
