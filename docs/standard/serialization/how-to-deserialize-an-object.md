# How to: Deserialize an Object
When you deserialize an object, the transport format determines whether you will create a stream or file object. After the transport format is determined, you can call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A> or <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A> methods, as required.  
  
### To deserialize an object  
  
1.  Construct a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> using the type of the object to deserialize.  
  
2.  Call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A> method to produce a replica of the object. When deserializing, you must cast the returned object to the type of the original, as shown in the following example, which deserializes the object into a file (although it could also be deserialized into a stream).  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim myObject As MySerializableClass  
    ' Construct an instance of the XmlSerializer with the type  
    ' of object that is being deserialized.  
    Dim mySerializer As XmlSerializer = New XmlSerializer(GetType(MySerializableClass))  
    ' To read the file, create a FileStream.  
    Dim myFileStream As FileStream = _  
    New FileStream("myFileName.xml", FileMode.Open)  
    ' Call the Deserialize method and cast to the object type.  
    myObject = CType( _  
    mySerializer.Deserialize(myFileStream), MySerializableClass)  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    MySerializableClass myObject;  
    // Construct an instance of the XmlSerializer with the type  
    // of object that is being deserialized.  
    XmlSerializer mySerializer =   
    new XmlSerializer(typeof(MySerializableClass));  
    // To read the file, create a FileStream.  
    FileStream myFileStream =   
    new FileStream("myFileName.xml", FileMode.Open);  
    // Call the Deserialize method and cast to the object type.  
    myObject = (MySerializableClass)   
    mySerializer.Deserialize(myFileStream)  
    ```
