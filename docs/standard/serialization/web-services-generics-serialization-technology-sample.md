# Web Services Generics Serialization Technology Sample
[Download Sample](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/B/47B2164C-E780-4B10-8DE4-2CB5B886E0A6/Technologies/Serialization/Xml%20Serialization/GenericsSerialization.zip.exe)  
  
 This sample shows how to use and control the serialization of generics in ASP.NET Web Services.  
  
### To build the sample using Visual Studio  
  
1.  Open Visual Studio and select **New Web Site** from the **File** menu.  
  
2.  In the **New Web Site** dialog, select from the left pane your desired programming language, then from the right pane, select **ASP.NET Web Service**.  
  
3.  Click **Browse** and navigate to the \CS\GenericsService subdirectory.  
  
4.  Select Service.asmx to open the file in Visual Studio.  
  
5.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The first five steps in this list are optional. The .NET Framework runtime will automatically generate the Web service the first time the service is requested.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The following steps are required to build the sample.  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[fileExplorer](../../../includes/fileexplorer-md.md)] and navigate to the \CS subdirectory.  
  
2.  Right-click the icon for the GenericsService subdirectory, and select **Sharing and Security**.  
  
3.  In the **Web Sharing** tab, select **Share this Folder**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Take note of the virtual directory name that is listed in the **Aliases** pane, because you will need it to run the sample.  
  
### To build the sample using Internet Information Services  
  
1.  Open the **Internet Information Services** management snap-in and expand **Web Sites**.  
  
2.  Left-click **Default Web Site**, select **New**, and then select **Virtual Directory?** to create the **Virtual Directory Creation Wizard**.  
  
3.  Click **Next**, enter the public alias for your virtual directory, and click **Next**.  
  
4.  Enter the path to the directory where you saved the sample (normally the \CS\GenericsService subdirectory) and click **Next**. Click **Next** to finish the wizard.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Take note of the virtual directory name that is listed in the **Alias** pane, because you will need it to run the sample.  
  
### To run the sample  
  
1.  Open a browser window and select its address bar.  
  
2.  Type **http://localhost/[virtual directory]/Service.asmx**, where [virtual directory] represents the virtual directory you created when you built the sample.  
  
## Remarks  
 The sample displays a default ASP.NET page that contains links to the definition of the Web Service. You can customize the display in addition to modifying the source code for the Web service.
