# Custom Serialization Order With XmlSerializer
[Download Sample](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/7/B/47B2164C-E780-4B10-8DE4-2CB5B886E0A6/Technologies/Serialization/Xml%20Serialization/CustomOrder.zip.exe)  
  
 This sample shows how to control the order of serialized and deserialized elements for XML serialization.  
  
 Review comments in the source code and build.proj files for more information on serialization.  
  
### To build the sample using the Command Prompt  
  
1.  Open the Command Prompt window and navigate to one of the language-specific subdirectories for the sample.  
  
2.  Type **msbuild CustomOrder.sln** at the command line.  
  
### To build the sample using Visual Studio  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[fileExplorer](../../../includes/fileexplorer-md.md)] and navigate to one of the language-specific subdirectories for the sample.  
  
2.  Double-click the icon for the CustomOrder.sln to open the file in Visual Studio.  
  
3.  In the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.  
  
4.  The sample application is built in the default \bin or \bin\Debug subdirectory.
