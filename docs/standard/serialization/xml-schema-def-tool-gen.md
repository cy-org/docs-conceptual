# How to: Use the XML Schema Definition Tool to Generate Classes and XML Schema Documents
The XML Schema Definition tool (Xsd.exe) allows you to generate an XML schema that describes a class or to generate the class defined by an XML schema. The following procedures show how to perform these operations.  
  
### To generate classes that conform to a specific schema  
  
1.  Open a command prompt.  
  
2.  Pass the XML Schema as an argument to the XML Schema Definition tool, which creates a set of classes that are precisely matched to the XML Schema, for example:  
  
    ```  
    xsd mySchema.xsd  
    ```  
  
     The tool can only process schemas that reference the World Wide Web Consortium XML specification of March 16, 2001. In other words, the XML Schema namespace must be "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```xml  
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
    <xs:schema attributeFormDefault="qualified" elementFormDefault="qualified" targetNamespace="" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">  
    ```  
  
3.  Modify the classes with methods, properties, or fields, as necessary. For more information about modifying a class with attributes, see [Controlling XML Serialization Using Attributes](../../../docs/standard/serialization/controlling-xml-serialization-using-attributes.md) and [Attributes That Control Encoded SOAP Serialization](../../../docs/standard/serialization/attributes-that-control-encoded-soap-serialization.md).  
  
 It is often useful to examine the schema of the XML stream that is generated when instances of a class (or classes) are serialized. For example, you might publish your schema for others to use, or you might compare it to a schema with which you are trying to achieve conformity.  
  
#### To generate an XML Schema document from a set of classes  
  
1.  Compile the class or classes into a DLL.  
  
2.  Open a command prompt.  
  
3.  Pass the DLL as an argument to Xsd.exe, for example:  
  
    ```  
    xsd MyFile.dll  
    ```  
  
     The schema (or schemas) will be written, beginning with the name "schema0.xsd".
