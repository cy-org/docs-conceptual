# How to: Implement a Client of the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern
The following code example demonstrates how to use a component that adheres to the [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md). The form for this example uses the `PrimeNumberCalculator` component described in [How to: Implement a Component That Supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/component-that-supports-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md).  
  
 When you run a project that uses this example, you will see a "Prime Number Calculator" form with a grid and two buttons: **Start New Task** and **Cancel**. You can click the **Start New Task** button several times in succession, and for each click, an asynchronous operation will begin a computation to determine if a randomly generated test number is prime. The form will periodically display progress and incremental results. Each operation is assigned a unique task ID. The result of the computation is displayed in the **Result** column; if the test number is not prime, it is labeled as **Composite,** and its first divisor is displayed.  
  
 Any pending operation can be canceled with the **Cancel** button. Multiple selections can be made.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Most numbers will not be prime. If you have not found a prime number after several completed operations, simply start more tasks, and eventually you will find some prime numbers.
