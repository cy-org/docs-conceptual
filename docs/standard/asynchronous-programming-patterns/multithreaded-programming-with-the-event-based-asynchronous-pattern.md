# Multithreaded Programming with the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern
There are a number of ways to expose asynchronous features to client code. The Event-based Asynchronous Pattern prescribes the recommended way for classes to present asynchronous behavior.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md)  
 Describes how the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern makes available the advantages of multithreaded applications while hiding many of the complex issues inherent in multithreaded design.  
  
 [Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/implementing-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  
 Describes the standardized way to package a class that has asynchronous features.  
  
 [Best Practices for Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/best-practices-for-implementing-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  
 Describes the requirements for exposing asynchronous features according to the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.  
  
 [Deciding When to Implement the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/deciding-when-to-implement-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  
 Describes how to determine when you should choose to implement the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern instead of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> pattern.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Implementing a Component That Supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/component-that-supports-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  
 Illustrates how to create a component that implements the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern. It is implemented using helper classes from the <xref:System.ComponentModel?displayProperty=fullName> namespace, which ensures that the component works correctly under any application model.  
  
 [How to: Use Components That Support the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/how-to-use-components-that-support-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  
 Describes how to use a component that supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.
