# Blocking Application Execution by Ending an Async Operation
Applications that cannot continue to do other work while waiting for the results of an asynchronous operation must block until the operation completes. Use one of the following options to block your application's main thread while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete:  
  
-   Call the asynchronous operations **End** *OperationName* method. This approach is demonstrated in this topic.  
  
-   Use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> returned by the asynchronous operation's **Begin** *OperationName* method. For an example that demonstrates this approach, see [Blocking Application Execution Using an AsyncWaitHandle](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/blocking-application-execution-using-an-asyncwaithandle.md).  
  
 Applications that use the **End** *OperationName* method to block until an asynchronous operation is complete will typically call the **Begin** *OperationName* method, perform any work that can be done without the results of the operation, and then call **End** *OperationName*.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the <xref:System.Net.Dns> class to retrieve Domain Name System information for a user-specified computer. Note that `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic) is passed for the <xref:System.Net.Dns.BeginGetHostByName%2A>`requestCallback` and `stateObject` parameters because these arguments are not required when using this approach.
