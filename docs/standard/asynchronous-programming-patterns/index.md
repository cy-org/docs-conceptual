# Asynchronous Programming Patterns

The .NET Framework provides three patterns for performing asynchronous operations:  
  
- Asynchronous Programming Model (APM) pattern (also called the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> pattern), where asynchronous operations require `Begin` and `End` methods (for example, `BeginWrite` and `EndWrite` for asynchronous write operations). This pattern is no longer recommended for new development. For more information, see [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm.md).  
  
- Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP), which requires a method that has the `Async` suffix, and also requires one or more events, event handler delegate types, and `EventArg`-derived types. EAP was introduced in the .NET Framework 2.0. It is no longer recommended for new development. For more information, see [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md).  
  
- Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP), which uses a single method to represent the initiation and completion of an asynchronous operation. TAP was introduced in the .NET Framework 4 and is the recommended approach to asynchronous programming in the .NET Framework. The [async](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md) keywords in C# and the [Async](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md) operators in Visual Basic Language add language support for TAP. For more information, see [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md).  
  
## Comparing Patterns  

For a quick comparison of how the three patterns model asynchronous operations, consider a `Read` method that reads a specified amount of data into a provided buffer starting at a specified offset:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public int Read(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count);  
}  
```  
  
The APM counterpart of this method would expose the `BeginRead` and `EndRead` methods:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public IAsyncResult BeginRead(  
        byte [] buffer, int offset, int count,   
        AsyncCallback callback, object state);  
    public int EndRead(IAsyncResult asyncResult);  
}  
```  
  
The EAP counterpart would expose the following set of types and members:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public void ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count);  
    public event ReadCompletedEventHandler ReadCompleted;  
}  
```  
  
The TAP counterpart would expose the following single `ReadAsync` method:  
  
```csharp  
public class MyClass  
{  
    public Task<int> ReadAsync(byte [] buffer, int offset, int count);  
}  
```
