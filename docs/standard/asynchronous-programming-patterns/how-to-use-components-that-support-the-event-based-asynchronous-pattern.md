# How to: Use Components That Support the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern
Many components provide you with the option of performing their work asynchronously. The <xref:System.Media.SoundPlayer> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> components, for example, enable you to load sounds and images "in the background" while your main thread continues running without interruption.  
  
 Using asynchronous methods on a class that supports the [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md) can be as simple as attaching an event handler to the component's *MethodName*`Completed` event, just as you would for any other event. When you call the *MethodName*`Async` method, your application will continue running without interruption until the *MethodName*`Completed` event is raised. In your event handler, you can examine the <xref:System.ComponentModel.AsyncCompletedEventArgs> parameter to determine if the asynchronous operation successfully completed or if it was canceled.  
  
 For more information about using event handlers, see [Event Handlers Overview](../../../docs/framework/winforms/event-handlers-overview-windows-forms.md).  
  
 The following procedure shows how to use the asynchronous image-loading capability of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control.  
  
### To enable a PictureBox control to asynchronously load an image  
  
1.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> component in your form.  
  
2.  Assign an event handler to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadCompleted> event.  
  
     Check for any errors that may have occurred during the asynchronous download here. This is also where you check for cancellation.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/CS/Form1.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/CS/Form1.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/VB/Form1.vb#5)]  
  
3.  Add two buttons, called `loadButton` and `cancelLoadButton`, to your form. Add <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event handlers to start and cancel the download.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/CS/Form1.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/CS/Form1.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync/VB/Form1.vb#4)]  
  
4.  Run your application.  
  
     As the image download proceeds, you can move the form freely, minimize it, and maximize it.
