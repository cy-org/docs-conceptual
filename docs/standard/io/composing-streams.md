# Composing Streams
A backing store is a storage medium, such as a disk or memory. Each different backing store implements its own stream as an implementation of the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class. Each stream type reads and writes bytes from and to its given backing store. Streams that connect to backing stores are called base streams. Base streams have constructors that have the parameters necessary to connect the stream to the backing store. For example, <xref:System.IO.FileStream> has constructors that specify a path parameter, which specifies how the file will be shared by processes, and so on.  
  
 The design of the <xref:System.IO> classes provides simplified stream composing. Base streams can be attached to one or more pass-through streams that provide the functionality you want. A reader or writer can be attached to the end of the chain so that the preferred types can be read or written easily.  
  
 The following code example creates a **FileStream** around the existing `MyFile.txt` in order to buffer `MyFile.txt`. (Note that **FileStreams** are buffered by default.) Next, a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> is created to read characters from the **FileStream**, which is passed to the **StreamReader** as its constructor argument. <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadLine%2A> reads until <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Peek%2A> finds no more characters.

 The following code example creates a **FileStream** around the existing `MyFile.txt` in order to buffer `MyFile.txt`. (Note that **FileStreams** are buffered by default.) Next, a **BinaryReader** is created to read bytes from the **FileStream**, which is passed to the **BinaryReader** as its constructor argument. <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadByte%2A> reads until <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader.PeekChar%2A> finds no more bytes.
