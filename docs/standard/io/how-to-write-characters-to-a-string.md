# How to: Write Characters to a String
The following code examples write characters synchronously and asynchronously from a character array into a string.  
  
## Example  
 The following example writes 5 characters synchronously from an array to a string.  
  
 [!code-csharp[Conceptual.StringBuilder#9](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.StringBuilder/cs/example2.cs#9)]
 [!code-vb[Conceptual.StringBuilder#9](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Conceptual.StringBuilder/vb/example2.vb#9)]  
  
## Example  
 The next example reads all the characters asynchronously from a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control, and stores them in an array. It then asynchronously writes each letter or white space character on a separate line followed by a line break to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control.
