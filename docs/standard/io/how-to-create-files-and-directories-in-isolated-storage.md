# How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage
After you have obtained an isolated store, you can create directories and files for storing data. Within a store, file and directory names are specified with respect to the root of the virtual file system.  
  
 To create a directory, use the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectory%2A?displayProperty=fullName> instance method. If you specify a subdirectory of an directory that doesn't exist, both directories are created. If you specify a directory that already exists, the method returns without creating a directory, and no exception is thrown. However, if you specify a directory name that contains invalid characters, an <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException> exception is thrown.  
  
 To create a file, use  the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateFile%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  
  
 In the Windows operating system, isolated storage file and directory names are case-insensitive. That is, if you create a file named `ThisFile.txt`, and then create another file named `THISFILE.TXT`, only one file is created. The file name keeps its original casing for display purposes.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example illustrates how to create files and directories in an isolated store.
