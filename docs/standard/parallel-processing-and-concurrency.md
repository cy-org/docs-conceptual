# Parallel Processing and Concurrency in the .NET Framework
The .NET Framework provides several ways for you to use multiple threads of execution to keep your application responsive to your user while maximizing the performance of your user's computer.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Threading](../../docs/standard/threading/index.md)  
 Describes the basic concurrency and synchronization mechanisms provided by the .NET Framework.  
  
 [Asynchronous Programming Patterns](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/index.md)  
 Provides a brief overview of the three asynchronous programming patterns supported in the .NET Framework:  
  
-   [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm.md) (legacy)  
  
-   [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md) (legacy)  
  
-   [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md) (recommended for new development)  
  
 [Parallel Programming](../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/index.md)  
 Describes a task-based programming model that simplifies parallel development, enabling you to write efficient, fine-grained, and scalable parallel code in a natural idiom without having to work directly with threads or the thread pool.
