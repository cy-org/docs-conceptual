# How to create user-defined exceptions

.NET provides a hierarchy of exception classes ultimately derived from the base class @System.Exception. However, if none of the predefined exceptions meets your needs, you can create your own exception classes by deriving from the @System.Exception class.

When creating your own exceptions, end the class name of the user-defined exception with the word "Exception," and implement the three common constructors, as shown in the following example. The example defines a new exception class named `EmployeeListNotFoundException`. The class is derived from @System.Exception and includes three constructors.

[!code-cpp[dg_exceptionDesign#14](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/dg_exceptionDesign/cpp/example2.cpp#14)]
[!code-csharp[dg_exceptionDesign#14](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/dg_exceptionDesign/cs/example2.cs#14)]
[!code-vb[dg_exceptionDesign#14](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/dg_exceptionDesign/vb/example2.vb#14)]  

> [!NOTE]
> In situations where you are using remoting, you must ensure that the metadata for any user-defined exceptions is available at the server (callee) and to the client (the proxy object or caller). For more information, see [Best practices for exceptions](best-practices-for-exceptions.md).
