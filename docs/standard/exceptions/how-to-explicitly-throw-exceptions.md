# How to explicitly throw exceptions

You can explicitly throw an exception using the `throw` statement. You can also throw a caught exception again using the `throw` statement. It is good coding practice to add information to an exception that is re-thrown to provide more information when debugging.

The following code example uses a `try`/`catch` block to catch a possible @System.IO.FileNotFoundException. Following the `try` block is a `catch` block that catches the @System.IO.FileNotFoundException and writes a message to the console if the data file is not found. The next statement is the `throw` statement that throws a new @System.IO.FileNotFoundException and adds text information to the exception.
