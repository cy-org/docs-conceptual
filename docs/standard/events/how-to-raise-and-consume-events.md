# How to: Raise and Consume Events
The examples in this topic show how to work with events. They include examples of the <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate, the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate, and a custom delegate, to illustrate events with and without data.  
  
 The examples use concepts described in the [Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md) article.  
  
## Example  
 The first example shows how to raise and consume an event that doesn't have data. It contains a class named `Counter` that has an event named `ThresholdReached`. This event is raised when a counter value equals or exceeds a threshold value. The <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate is associated with the event, because no event data is provided.

## Example  
 The next example shows how to raise and consume an event that provides data. The <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate is associated with the event, and an instance of a custom event data object is provided.

 [!code-vb[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/vb/module1withdata.vb#6)]  
  
## Example  
 The next example shows how to declare a delegate for an event. The delegate is named `ThresholdReachedEventHandler`. This is just an illustration. Typically, you do not have to declare a delegate for an event, because you can use either the <xref:System.EventHandler> or the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate. You should declare a delegate only in rare scenarios, such as making your class available to legacy code that cannot use generics.
