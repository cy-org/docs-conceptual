# How to: Traverse a Binary Tree with Parallel Tasks
The following example shows two ways in which parallel tasks can be used to traverse a tree data structure. The creation of the tree itself is left as an exercise.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[TPL#16](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/cs/tpl.cs#16)]
 [!code-vb[TPL#16](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/vb/treewalk.vb#16)]  
  
 The two methods shown are functionally equivalent. By using the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory.StartNew%2A> method to create and run the tasks, you get a handle back from the tasks which can be used to wait on the tasks and handle exceptions.
