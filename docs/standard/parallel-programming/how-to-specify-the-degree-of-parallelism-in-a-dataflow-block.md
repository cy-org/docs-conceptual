# How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block
This document describes how to set the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to enable an execution dataflow block to process more than one message at a time. Doing this is useful when you have a dataflow block that performs a long-running computation and can benefit from processing messages in parallel. This example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName> class to perform multiple dataflow operations concurrently; however, you can specify the maximum degree of parallelism in any of the predefined execution block types that the TPL Dataflow Library provides, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601>, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformManyBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The TPL Dataflow Library (the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow?displayProperty=fullName> namespace) is not distributed with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]. To install the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow> namespace, open your project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], choose **Manage NuGet Packages** from the Project menu, and search online for the `Microsoft.Tpl.Dataflow` package.  
  
## Example  
 The following example performs two dataflow computations and prints the elapsed time that is required for each computation. The first computation specifies a maximum degree of parallelism of 1, which is the default. A maximum degree of parallelism of 1 causes the dataflow block to process messages serially. The second computation resembles the first, except that it specifies a maximum degree of parallelism that is equal to the number of available processors. This enables the dataflow block to perform multiple operations in parallel.

 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_DegreeOfParallelism#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_degreeofparallelism/vb/dataflowdegreeofparallelism.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.cs` (`DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.vb` for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]), and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]  
  
 **csc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.cs**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]  
  
 **vbc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.vb**  
  
## Robust Programming  
 By default, each predefined dataflow block propagates out messages in the order in which the messages are received.  Although multiple messages are processed simultaneously when you specify a maximum degree of parallelism that is greater than 1, they are still propagated out in the order in which they are received.  
  
 Because the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism%2A> property represents the maximum degree of parallelism, the dataflow block might execute with a lesser degree of parallelism than you specify. The dataflow block can use a lesser degree of parallelism to meet its functional requirements or to account for a lack of available system resources. A dataflow block never chooses a greater degree of parallelism than you specify.
