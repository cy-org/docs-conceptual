# How to: Write Messages to and Read Messages from a Dataflow Block
This document describes how to use the TPL Dataflow Library to write messages to and read messages from a dataflow block. The TPL Dataflow Library provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for writing messages to and reading messages from a dataflow block. This document uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName> class. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> class buffers messages and behaves as both a message source and as a message target.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The TPL Dataflow Library (<xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow?displayProperty=fullName> namespace) is not distributed with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]. To install the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow> namespace, open your project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], choose **Manage NuGet Packages** from the Project menu, and search online for the `Microsoft.Tpl.Dataflow` package.  
  
## Writing to and Reading from a Dataflow Block Synchronously  
 The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Post%2A> method to write to a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> dataflow block and the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Receive%2A> method to read from the same object.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/cs/dataflowreadwrite.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/vb/dataflowreadwrite.vb#2)]  
  
 You can also use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601.TryReceive%2A> method to read from a dataflow block, as shown in the following example. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601.TryReceive%2A> method does not block the current thread and is useful when you occasionally poll for data.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/cs/dataflowreadwrite.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/vb/dataflowreadwrite.vb#3)]  
  
 Because the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Post%2A> method acts synchronously, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> object in the previous examples receives all data before the second loop reads data. The following example extends the first example by using <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.Invoke%2A> to read from and write to the message block concurrently. Because <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.Invoke%2A> performs actions concurrently, the values are not written to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> object in any specific order.

 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/vb/dataflowreadwrite.vb#4)]  
  
## Writing to and Reading from a Dataflow Block Asynchronously  
 The following example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.SendAsync%2A> method to asynchronously write to a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> object and the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.ReceiveAsync%2A> method to asynchronously read from the same object. This example uses the [async](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md) operators ([Async](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md) in Visual Basic) to asynchronously send data to and read data from the target block. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.SendAsync%2A> method is useful when you must enable a dataflow block to postpone messages. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.ReceiveAsync%2A> method is useful when you want to act on data when that data becomes available. For more information about how messages propagate among message blocks, see the section Message Passing in [Dataflow](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library.md).

 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/vb/dataflowreadwrite.vb#5)]  
  
## A Complete Example  
 The following example shows the complete code for this document.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/cs/dataflowreadwrite.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ReadWrite#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_readwrite/vb/dataflowreadwrite.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `DataflowReadWrite.cs` (`DataflowReadWrite.vb` for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]), and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]  
  
 **csc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowReadWrite.cs**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]  
  
 **vbc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowReadWrite.vb**  
  
## Next Steps  
 This example shows how to read from and write to a message block directly. You can also connect dataflow blocks to form *pipelines*, which are linear sequences of dataflow blocks, or *networks*, which are graphs of dataflow blocks. In a pipeline or network, sources asynchronously propagate data to targets as that data becomes available. For an example that creates a basic dataflow pipeline, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Dataflow Pipeline](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/walkthrough-creating-a-dataflow-pipeline.md). For an example that creates a more complex dataflow network, see [Walkthrough: Using Dataflow in a Windows Forms Application](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/walkthrough-using-dataflow-in-a-windows-forms-application.md).
