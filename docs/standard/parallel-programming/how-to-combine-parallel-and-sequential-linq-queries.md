# How to: Combine Parallel and Sequential LINQ Queries
This example shows how to use the <xref:System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.AsSequential%2A> method to instruct PLINQ to process all subsequent operators in the query sequentially. Although sequential processing is generally slower than parallel, sometimes it is necessary to produce correct results.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  This example is intended to demonstrate usage, and might not run faster than the equivalent sequential LINQ to Objects query. For more information about speedup, see [Understanding Speedup in PLINQ](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/understanding-speedup-in-plinq.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows one scenario in which <xref:System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.AsSequential%2A> is required, namely to preserve the ordering that was established in a previous clause of the query.

## Compiling the Code  
 To compile and run this code, paste it into the [PLINQ Data Sample](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/plinq-data-sample.md) project, add a line to call the method from `Main`, and press F5.
