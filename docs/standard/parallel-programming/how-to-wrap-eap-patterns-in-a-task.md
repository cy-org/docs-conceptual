# How to: Wrap EAP Patterns in a Task
The following example shows how to expose an arbitrary sequence of Event-Based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP) operations as one task by using a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCompletionSource%601>. The example also shows how to use a <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> to invoke the built-in cancellation methods on the <xref:System.Net.WebClient> objects.  
  
## Example
