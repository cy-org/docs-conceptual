# How to: Implement a Producer-Consumer Dataflow Pattern
This document describes how to use the TPL Dataflow Library to implement a producer-consumer pattern. In this pattern, the *producer* sends messages to a message block, and the *consumer* reads messages from that block.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The TPL Dataflow Library (<xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow?displayProperty=fullName> namespace) is not distributed with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]. To install the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow> namespace, open your project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], choose **Manage NuGet Packages** from the Project menu, and search online for the `Microsoft.Tpl.Dataflow` package.  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates a basic producer- consumer model that uses dataflow. The `Produce` method writes arrays that contain random bytes of data to a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ITargetBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName> object and the `Consume` method reads bytes from a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName> object. By acting on the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ITargetBlock%601> interfaces, instead of their derived types, you can write reusable code that can act on a variety of dataflow block types. This example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> class. Because the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock%601> class acts as both a source block and as a target block, the producer and the consumer can use a shared object to transfer data.  
  
 The `Produce` method calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.Post%2A> method in a loop to synchronously write data to the target block. After the `Produce` method writes all data to the target block, it calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IDataflowBlock.Complete%2A> method to indicate that the block will never have additional data available. The `Consume` method uses the [async](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md) operators ([Async](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) and [Await](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md) in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) to asynchronously compute the total number of bytes that are received from the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ISourceBlock%601> object. To act asynchronously, the `Consume` method calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.OutputAvailableAsync%2A> method to receive a notification when the source block has data available and when the source block will never have additional data available.

 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ProducerConsumer#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_producerconsumer/vb/dataflowproducerconsumer.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `DataflowProducerConsumer.cs` (`DataflowProducerConsumer.vb` for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]), and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]  
  
 **csc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowProducerConsumer.cs**  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]  
  
 **vbc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowProducerConsumer.vb**  
  
## Robust Programming  
 This example uses just one consumer to process the source data. If you have multiple consumers in your application, use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601.TryReceive%2A> method to read data from the source block, as shown in the following example.  
  
 [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_ProducerConsumer#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_producerconsumer/cs/dataflowproducerconsumer.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_ProducerConsumer#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_producerconsumer/vb/dataflowproducerconsumer.vb#2)]  
  
 The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.IReceivableSourceBlock%601.TryReceive%2A> method returns `False` when no data is available. When multiple consumers must access the source block concurrently, this mechanism guarantees that data is still available after the call to <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.DataflowBlock.OutputAvailableAsync%2A>.
