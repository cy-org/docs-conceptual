# XmlSchemaCollection Schema Compilation
The **XmlSchemaCollection** is a cache or library where XML-Data Reduced (XDR) and XML Schema definition language (XSD) schemas can be stored and validated. **XmlSchemaCollection** improves performance by caching schemas in memory instead of accessing them from a file or URL.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Although the **XmlSchemaCollection** class stores both XDR schemas and XML Schemas, any method and property that takes or returns an **XmlSchema** object supports XML Schemas only.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaCollection> class is now obsolete and has been replaced with the <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaSet> class. For more information about the <xref:System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaSet> class see, [XmlSchemaSet for Schema Compilation](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xmlschemaset-for-schema-compilation.md).  
  
## Add Schemas to the Collection  
 Schemas are loaded to the collection using the **Add** method of **XmlSchemaCollection**, at which time the schema is associated with a namespace URI. For XML Schemas, the namespace URI will typically be the target namespace for the schema. For XDR schemas, the namespace URI is the namespace specified when the schema was added to the collection.  
  
## Check for a Schema in the Collection  
 You can check to see if a schema is in the collection by using the **Contains** method. The **Contains** method takes either an **XmlSchema** object (for XML Schemas only) or a string representing the namespace URI associated with the schema (for XML Schemas and XDR schemas).  
  
## Retrieve a Schema from the Collection  
 You can retrieve a schema from the collection by using the **Item** property. The **Item** property takes a string representing the namespace URI associated with the schema, typically its target namespace, and returns an **XmlSchema** object. The **Item** property applies to XML Schemas only. The return value is always a null reference for XDR schemas because they do not have an object model available.  
  
## Validate XML Documents Using XmlSchemaCollection  
 You can validate an XML instance document using an **XmlSchemaCollection** by creating the **XmlSchemaCollection** object, adding your schemas to the collection, and setting the **Schemas** property on the **XmlValidatingReader** to assign the created **XmlSchemaCollection** to the **XmlValidatingReader**.  
  
### Improved Performance  
 It is recommended, if you are validating more than one document against the same schema, that you use the **XmlSchemaCollection** because it provides better performance by caching schemas in memory.  
  
 The following code example creates the **XmlSchemaCollection** object, adds schemas to the collection, and sets the **Schemas** property.  
  
```vb  
Dim tr as XmlTextReader = new XmlTextReader("Books.xml")  
Dim vr as XmlValidatingReader = new XmlValidatingReader(tr)  
Dim xsc as XmlSchemaCollection = new XmlSchemaCollection  
xsc.Add("urn:bookstore-schema", "Books.xsd")  
vr.Schemas.Add(xsc)  
```  
  
```csharp  
XmlTextReader tr = new XmlTextReader("Books.xml");  
XmlValidatingReader vr = new XmlValidatingReader(tr);  
XmlSchemaCollection xsc = new XmlSchemaCollection();  
xsc.Add("urn:bookstore-schema", "Books.xsd");    
vr.Schemas.Add(xsc);  
```
