# Copy Existing Nodes
There are many methods and properties in the XML Document Object Model (DOM)you can use to select a node, such as **SelectSingleNode**, **ChildNodes[int i]**, **Attributes[int i]**. Once the node is selected, you can insert it into the tree using one of the insert methods that work for that particular node type. The only restriction to inserting a node into the tree is that the document must still be well-formed after the node is inserted. When an existing node is inserted into the DOM tree, it is removed from its original position and added to its target position.
