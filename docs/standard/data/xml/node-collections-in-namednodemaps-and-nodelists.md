# Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists
You can retrieve a set of nodes and put it in an ordered or unordered collection. When putting a set of nodes into an unordered collection, the set is called a NamedNodeMap by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); you can retrieve the data by name or index in this type of collection. Putting a set of nodes in an ordered collection is called a NodeList by the W3C, and the data can be retrieved by a zero-based index. NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists are described by the W3C. The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the **XmlNamedNodeMap**, and the NodeList is implemented by the **XmlNodeList**.  
  
 For information on the unordered collection, see [Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md). For information on the ordered collection, see [Ordered Node Retrieval by Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md).
