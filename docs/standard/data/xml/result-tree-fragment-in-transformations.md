# Result Tree Fragment in Transformations
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class is obsolete in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnext](../../../../includes/dnprdnext-md.md)]. You can perform Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) transformations using the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform> class. See [Using the XslCompiledTransform Class](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/using-the-xslcompiledtransform-class.md) and [Migrating From the XslTransform Class](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/migrating-from-the-xsltransform-class.md) for more information.  
  
 Result tree fragments, also known as result tree fragments, are nothing more than a special type of node set. You can perform any function on them that can be performed on a node set. Or, you can also convert a result tree fragment to a node set using the `node-set()` function and subsequently use it any place that a node set can be used.  
  
 A result tree fragment is created as a result of using an `<xsl:variable>` or `<xsl:param>` element in a specific manner in a style sheet. The syntax for the `variable` and `parameter` elements is as follows:  
  
```xml  
<xsl:param name=Qname select= XPath Expression >  
    template body  
</xsl:param>  
  
<xsl:variable name=Qname select=XPath Expression >  
    template body  
</xsl:variable>  
```  
  
 For the `parameter` element, the value is assigned to the qualified name (`Qname`) in several ways. You can assign a default value to the parameter by returning content from the XML Path Language (XPath) expression in the `select` attribute, or by assigning it the contents of the template body.  
  
 For the `variable` element, the value is also assigned in several ways. You can assign it by returning content from the XPath expression in the `select` attribute, or by assigning it the contents of the template body.  
  
 For both the `parameter` and `variable` elements, if a value is assigned by the XPath expression, then one of the four basic XPath types will be returned: Boolean, string, number, or node set. When the value is given by using a non-empty template body, then a non-XPath data type is returned, and that will be a result tree fragment.  
  
 When a variable is bound to a result tree fragment instead of one of the four basic XPath data types, this is the only time that an XPath query returns a type that is not one of the four XPath object types. Result tree fragments and their behavior are discussed in the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specification at www.w3.org/XSLT, section 11.1 Result Tree Fragments through section 11.6 Passing Parameters to Templates. Also, section 1 Introduction discusses how templates can contain elements from the XSLT namespace that return or create result tree fragments.  
  
 A result tree fragment, in concept, behaves like a node set with nothing more than a single root node. However, the rest of the nodes returned are child nodes. To programmatically see the child nodes, copy the result tree fragment to the result tree using the `<xsl:copy-of>` element. When the copy-of is performed, all the child nodes are also copied to the result tree in sequence. Until a `copy` or `copy-of` is used, a result tree fragment is not part of the result tree or the output from the transformation.  
  
 To iterate over the returned nodes of a result tree fragment, an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is used. The following code sample shows how to create a result tree fragment within a style sheet by calling the function with a parameter `fragment`, which contains XML.  
  
```xml  
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"  
                xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"  
                xmlns:user="http://www.adventure-works.com"  
                version="1.0">  
    <xsl:var name="fragment">  
        <node1>  
            <node2/>  
        </node1>  
    <xsl:var>  
  
  <msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="user">  
    function NodeFragment(XPathNavigator nav)  
    {  
      if (nav.HasSelection == false)  
        XPathNavigator.MoveToNext();  
      return;  
    }  
  </msxsl:script>  
  
    <xsl:template match="/">  
            <xsl:value-of select="user:NodeFragment(msxml:node-set($fragment))"/>  
    </xsl:template>  
</xsl:stylesheet>  
```  
  
 Here is another sample showing a variable, which is in Rich Text Format (RTF), and hence, a type of result tree fragment, that is not converted to a node set. Instead, it is passed to a script function, and the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is used to navigate over the nodes.  
  
```xml  
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"  
        xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"  
        xmlns:user="urn:books"  
        exclude-result-prefixes="msxsl">  
  
<xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes" omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>  
  
<xsl:variable name="node-fragment">  
    <book>Book1</book>  
    <book>Book2</book>  
    <book>Book3</book>  
    <book>Book4</book>  
</xsl:variable>  
  
<msxsl:script implements-prefix="user" language="c#">  
  
<![CDATA[  
    string func(XPathNavigator nav)  
    {  
        bool b = nav.MoveToFirstChild();  
        if (b)  
            return nav.Value;  
        else  
            return "Does not exist";  
    }  
  
]]>  
  
</msxsl:script>  
  
<xsl:template match="/">  
    <first_book>  
        <xsl:value-of select="user:func($node-fragment)"/>  
    </first_book>  
</xsl:template>  
  
</xsl:stylesheet>  
```  
  
 The result of transforming any XML with this style sheet is shown in the following output.  
  
## Output  
  
```xml  
<first_book xmlns:user="urn:books">Book1</first_book>  
```  
  
 As stated above, the `node-set` function enables you to convert a result tree fragment into a node set. The resulting node always contains a single node that is the root node of the tree. If you convert a result tree fragment to a node set, then you can use it anywhere a regular node set is used, such as in a for-each statement or in the value of a `select` attribute. The following lines of code show the fragment being converted to a node set and used as a node set:  
  
 `<xsl:for-each select="msxsl:node-set($node-fragment)">`  
  
 `<xsl:value-of select="user:func(msxsl:node-set($node-fragment))"/>`  
  
 When a fragment is converted to a node set, you no longer use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> to navigate over it. For a node set, you use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> instead.  
  
 In the following example, `$var` is a variable that is a node tree in the style sheet. The for-each statement, combined with the `node-set` function, allows the user to iterate over this tree as a node set.  
  
```xml  
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"  
                xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"  
                xmlns:user="http://www.adventure-works.com"  
                version="1.0">  
    <xsl:variable name="states">  
        <node1>AL</node1>  
        <node1>CA</node1>  
        <node1>CO</node1>  
        <node1>WA</node1>  
    </xsl:variable>  
  
    <xsl:template match="/">  
            <xsl:for-each select="msxsl:node-set($states)"/>   
    </xsl:template>  
</xsl:stylesheet>  
```  
  
 Here is another example of a variable that is in RTF, and hence of type result tree fragment, that is converted to a node set before being passed to a script function as XPathNodeIterator.  
  
```xml  
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"  
        xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"  
        xmlns:user="urn:books"  
        exclude-result-prefixes="msxsl">  
  
<xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes" omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>  
  
<xsl:variable name="node-fragment">  
    <book>Book1</book>  
    <book>Book2</book>  
    <book>Book3</book>  
    <book>Book4</book>  
</xsl:variable>  
  
<msxsl:script implements-prefix="user" language="c#">  
  
<![CDATA[  
    string func(XPathNodeIterator it)  
    {  
        it.MoveNext();   
        return it.Current.Value;   
        //it.Current returns XPathNavigator positioned on the current node  
    }  
  
]]>  
  
</msxsl:script>  
<xsl:template match="/">  
    <books>  
        <xsl:value-of select="user:func(msxsl:node-set($node-fragment))"/>  
    </books>  
</xsl:template>  
  
</xsl:stylesheet>  
```  
  
 The following is the result of transforming XML with this style sheet:  
  
```xml  
<books xmlns:user="urn:books">Book1Book2Book3Book4</books>  
```
