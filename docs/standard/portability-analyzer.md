# The .NET Portability Analyzer

Want to make your libraries multi-platform? Want to see how much work is required to make your application compatible with other .NET implementations? The [.NET Portability Analyzer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507467) is a tool that provides you with a detailed report on how flexible your program is across .NET implementations by analyzing assemblies. The Portability Analyzer is offered as a Visual Studio Extension and as a console app.

## New targets

* [.NET Core](https://dotnetfoundation.org/net-core): Has a modular design, employs side-by-side, and targets cross-platform scenarios. Side-by-side allows you to adopt new .NET Core versions without breaking other apps.
* [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnetfoundation.org/asp-net-core): is a modern web-framework built on .NET Core thus giving developers the same benefits.
* [Universal Windows Platform](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/04/24/net-native-performance): Improve performance of your Windows Store apps that run on x64 and ARM machines by using .NET Native’s static compilation. 
* .NET Core + Platform Extensions: Includes the .NET Core APIs in addition to other APIs in the .NET ecosystem such as WCF, ASP.NET Core, FSharp, and Azure.
* .NET Standard + Platform Extensions: Includes the .NET Standard APIs in addition to other .NET ecosystem such as WCF, ASP.NET Core, FSharp, and Azure.

## How to use Portability Analyzer

To begin using the .NET Portability Analyzer, you first need to download and install the extension from the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507467). It works on Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017. You can configure it in Visual Studio via **Analyze** > **Portability Analyzer Settings** and select your Target Platforms.

To analyze your entire project, right-click on your project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Analyze Assembly Portability**. Otherwise, go to the **Analyze** menu and select **Analyze Assembly Portability**. From there, select your project’s executable or DLL.

After running the analysis, you will see your .NET Portability Report. Only types that are unsupported by a target platform appear in the list and you can review recommendations in the **Messages** tab in the **Error List**. You can also jump to problem areas directly from the **Messages** tab.

Don’t want to use Visual Studio? You can also use the Portability Analyzer from the command prompt. Just download the [API Portability Analyzer](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42678).

*   Type the following command to analyze the current directory: `\...\ApiPort.exe analyze -f .`
*   To analyze a specific list of .dll files, type the following command: `\...\ApiPort.exe analyze -f first.dll -f second.dll -f third.dll`

Your .NET Portability Report is saved as an Excel file (*.xlsx*) in your current directory. The **Details** tab in the Excel Workbook contains more information.
