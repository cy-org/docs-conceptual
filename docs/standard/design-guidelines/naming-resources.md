# Naming Resources
Because localizable resources can be referenced via certain objects as if they were properties, the naming guidelines for resources are similar to property guidelines.  
  
 **✓ DO** use PascalCasing in resource keys.  
  
 **✓ DO** provide descriptive rather than short identifiers.  
  
 **X DO NOT** use language-specific keywords of the main CLR languages.  
  
 **✓ DO** use only alphanumeric characters and underscores in naming resources.  
  
 **✓ DO** use the following naming convention for exception message resources.  
  
 The resource identifier should be the exception type name plus a short identifier of the exception:  
  
 `ArgumentExceptionIllegalCharacters`   
 `ArgumentExceptionInvalidName`   
 `ArgumentExceptionFileNameIsMalformed`
