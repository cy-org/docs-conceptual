# Static Class Design
A static class is defined as a class that contains only static members (of course besides the instance members inherited from <xref:System.Object?displayProperty=fullName> and possibly a private constructor). Some languages provide built-in support for static classes. In C# 2.0 and later, when a class is declared to be static, it is sealed, abstract, and no instance members can be overridden or declared.  
  
 Static classes are a compromise between pure object-oriented design and simplicity. They are commonly used to provide shortcuts to other operations (such as <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName>), holders of extension methods, or functionality for which a full object-oriented wrapper is unwarranted (such as <xref:System.Environment?displayProperty=fullName>).  
  
 **✓ DO** use static classes sparingly.  
  
 Static classes should be used only as supporting classes for the object-oriented core of the framework.  
  
 **X DO NOT** treat static classes as a miscellaneous bucket.  
  
 **X DO NOT** declare or override instance members in static classes.  
  
 **✓ DO** declare static classes as sealed, abstract, and add a private instance constructor if your programming language does not have built-in support for static classes.
