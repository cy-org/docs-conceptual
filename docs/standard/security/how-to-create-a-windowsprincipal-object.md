# How to: Create a WindowsPrincipal Object
There are two ways to create a <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object, depending on whether code must repeatedly perform role-based validation or must perform it only once.  
  
 If code must repeatedly perform role-based validation, the first of the following procedures produces less overhead. When code needs to make role-based validations only once, you can create a <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object by using the second of the following procedures.  
  
### To create a WindowsPrincipal object for repeated validation  
  
1.  Call the <xref:System.AppDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy%2A> method on the <xref:System.AppDomain> object that is returned by the static <xref:System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, passing the method a <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy> enumeration value that indicates what the new policy should be. Supported values are <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.NoPrincipal>, <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.UnauthenticatedPrincipal>, and <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal>. The following code demonstrates this method call.  
  
    ```csharp  
    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy(  
        PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal);  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy( _  
        PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal)  
    ```  
  
2.  With the policy set, use the static <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to retrieve the principal that encapsulates the current Windows user. Because the property return type is <xref:System.Security.Principal.IPrincipal>, you must cast the result to a <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> type. The following code initializes a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object to the value of the principal associated with the current thread.  
  
    ```csharp  
    WindowsPrincipal MyPrincipal =   
        (WindowsPrincipal) Thread.CurrentPrincipal;  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim MyPrincipal As WindowsPrincipal = _  
        CType(Thread.CurrentPrincipal, WindowsPrincipal)   
    ```  
  
3.  When the principal object has been created, you can use one of several methods to validate it.  
  
### To create a WindowsPrincipal object for a single validation  
  
1.  Initialize a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> object by calling the static <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, which queries the current Windows account and places information about that account into the newly created identity object. The following code creates a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> object and initializes it to the current authenticated user.  
  
    ```csharp  
    WindowsIdentity MyIdentity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent();  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim MyIdentity As WindowsIdentity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()  
    ```  
  
2.  Create a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object and pass it the value of the <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> object created in the preceding step.  
  
    ```csharp  
    WindowsPrincipal MyPrincipal = new WindowsPrincipal(MyIdentity);  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim MyPrincipal As New WindowsPrincipal(MyIdentity)  
    ```  
  
3.  When the principal object has been created, you can use one of several methods to validate it.
