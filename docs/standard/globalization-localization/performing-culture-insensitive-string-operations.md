# Performing Culture-Insensitive String Operations
Most .NET Framework methods that perform culture-sensitive string operations by default provide method overloads that allow you to explicitly specify the culture to use by passing a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> parameter. These overloads allow you to eliminate cultural variations in case mappings and sorting rules and guarantee culture-insensitive results.  
  
 This section provides the following topics to demonstrate how to perform culture-insensitive string operations using .NET Framework methods that are culture-sensitive by default.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/performing-culture-insensitive-string-comparisons.md)  
 Describes how to use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to perform culture-insensitive string comparisons.  
  
 [Performing Culture-Insensitive Case Changes](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/performing-culture-insensitive-case-changes.md)  
 Describes how to use the <xref:System.String.ToUpper%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.String.ToLower%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Char.ToUpper%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Char.ToLower%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to perform culture-insensitive case changes.  
  
 [Performing Culture-Insensitive String Operations in Collections](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/performing-culture-insensitive-string-operations-in-collections.md)  
 Describes how to use the <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveComparer>, <xref:System.Collections.CaseInsensitiveHashCodeProvider> class, <xref:System.Collections.SortedList>, <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Collections.Specialized.CollectionsUtil.CreateCaseInsensitiveHashtable%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to perform culture-insensitive operations in collections.  
  
 [Performing Culture-Insensitive String Operations in Arrays](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/performing-culture-insensitive-string-operations-in-arrays.md)  
 Describes how to use the <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Array.BinarySearch%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to perform culture-insensitive operations in arrays.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Culture-Insensitive String Operations](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/culture-insensitive-string-operations.md)  
 Describes why you should be aware of culture when performing operations on strings and provides guidelines for when to perform culture-sensitive operations and when to perform culture-insensitive operations.
