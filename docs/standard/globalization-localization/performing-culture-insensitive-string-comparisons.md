# Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons
By default, the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method performs culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons. This method also includes several overloads that provide a `culture` parameter that lets you specify the culture to use, and a `comparisonType` parameter that lets you specify the comparison rules to use. Calling these methods instead of the default overload removes any ambiguity about the rules used in a particular method call, and makes it clear whether a particular comparison is culture-sensitive or culture-insensitive.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Both overloads of the <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method perform culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons; you cannot use this method to perform culture-insensitive comparisons. For code clarity, we recommend that you use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method instead.  
  
 For culture-sensitive operations, specify the <xref:System.StringComparison.CurrentCulture?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration value as the `comparisonType` parameter. If you want to perform a culture-sensitive comparison using a designated culture other than the current culture, specify the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture as the `culture` parameter.  
  
 The culture-insensitive string comparisons supported by the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method are either linguistic (based on the sorting conventions of the invariant culture) or non-linguistic (based on the ordinal value of the characters in the string). Most culture-insensitive string comparisons are non-linguistic. For these comparisons, specify the <xref:System.StringComparison.Ordinal?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration value as the `comparisonType` parameter. For example, if a security decision (such as a user name or password comparison) is based on the result of a string comparison, the operation should be culture-insensitive and non-linguistic to ensure that the result is not affected by the conventions of a particular culture or language.  
  
 Use culture-insensitive linguistic string comparison if you want to handle linguistically relevant strings from multiple cultures in a consistent way. For example, if your application displays words that use multiple character sets in a list box, you might want to display words in the same order regardless of the current culture. For culture-insensitive linguistic comparisons, the .NET Framework defines an invariant culture that is based on the linguistic conventions of English. To perform a culture-insensitive linguistic comparison, specify <xref:System.StringComparison.InvariantCulture?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase?displayProperty=fullName> as the `comparisonType` parameter.  
  
 The following example performs two culture-insensitive, non-linguistic string comparisons. The first is case-sensitive, but the second is not.
