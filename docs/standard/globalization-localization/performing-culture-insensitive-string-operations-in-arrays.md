# Performing Culture-Insensitive String Operations in Arrays
Overloads of the <xref:System.Array.Sort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Array.BinarySearch%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods perform culture-sensitive sorts by default using the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. Culture-sensitive results returned by these methods can vary by culture due to differences in sort orders. To eliminate culture-sensitive behavior, use one of the overloads of this method that accepts a `comparer` parameter. The `comparer` parameter specifies the <xref:System.Collections.IComparer> implementation to use when comparing elements in the array. For the parameter, specify a custom invariant comparer class that uses <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. An example of a custom invariant comparer class is provided in the "Using the SortedList Class" subtopic of the [Performing Culture-Insensitive String Operations in Collections](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/performing-culture-insensitive-string-operations-in-collections.md) topic.  
  
 **Note** Passing **CultureInfo.InvariantCulture** to a comparison method does perform a culture-insensitive comparison. However, it does not cause a non-linguistic comparison, for example, for file paths, registry keys, and environment variables. Neither does it support security decisions based on the comparison result. For a non-linguistic comparison or support for result-based security decisions, the application should use a comparison method that accepts a <xref:System.StringComparison> value. The application should then pass <xref:System.StringComparison.Ordinal>.
