# Implementing resilient Entity Framework Core SQL connections

For Azure SQL DB, Entity Framework Core already provides internal database connection resiliency and retry logic. But you need to enable the Entity Framework execution strategy for each DbContext connection if you want to have [resilient EF Core connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency).

For instance, the following code at the EF Core connection level enables resilient SQL connections that are retried if the connection fails.

```csharp
// Startup.cs from any ASP.NET Core Web API
public class Startup
{
    // Other code ...
    public IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // ...
        services.AddDbContext<OrderingContext>(options =>
        {
            options.UseSqlServer(Configuration["ConnectionString"],
            sqlServerOptionsAction: sqlOptions =>
            {
                sqlOptions.EnableRetryOnFailure(
                maxRetryCount: 5,
                maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
                errorNumbersToAdd: null);
            });
        });
    }
//...
}
```

## Execution strategies and explicit transactions using BeginTransaction and multiple DbContexts

When retries are enabled in EF Core connections, each operation you perform using EF Core becomes its own retriable operation. Each query and each call to SaveChanges will be retried as a unit if a transient failure occurs.

However, if your code initiates a transaction using BeginTransaction, you are defining your own group of operations that need to be treated as a unitâ€”everything inside the transaction has be rolled back if a failure occurs. You will see an exception like the following if you attempt to execute that transaction when using an EF execution strategy (retry policy) and you include several SaveChanges calls from multiple DbContexts in the transaction.

> System.InvalidOperationException: The configured execution strategy 'SqlServerRetryingExecutionStrategy' does not support user initiated transactions. Use the execution strategy returned by 'DbContext.Database.CreateExecutionStrategy()' to execute all the operations in the transaction as a retriable unit.

The solution is to manually invoke the EF execution strategy with a delegate representing everything that needs to be executed. If a transient failure occurs, the execution strategy will invoke the delegate again. For example, the following code show how it is implemented in eShopOnContainers with two multiple DbContexts (\_catalogContext and the IntegrationEventLogContext) when updating a product and then saving the ProductPriceChangedIntegrationEvent object, which needs to use a different DbContext.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateProduct([FromBody]CatalogItem
    productToUpdate)
{
    // Other code ...
    // Update current product
    catalogItem = productToUpdate;

    // Use of an EF Core resiliency strategy when using multiple DbContexts
    // within an explicit transaction
    // See:
    // https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/connection-resiliency
    var strategy = _catalogContext.Database.CreateExecutionStrategy();
    await strategy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        // Achieving atomicity between original Catalog database operation and the
        // IntegrationEventLog thanks to a local transaction
        using (var transaction = _catalogContext.Database.BeginTransaction())
        {
            _catalogContext.CatalogItems.Update(catalogItem);
            await _catalogContext.SaveChangesAsync();
            // Save to EventLog only if product price changed
            if (raiseProductPriceChangedEvent)
            await _integrationEventLogService.SaveEventAsync(priceChangedEvent);
            transaction.Commit();
        }
    });
}
```

The first DbContext is \_catalogContext and the second DbContext is within the \_integrationEventLogService object. The Commit action is performed across multiple DbContexts using an EF execution strategy.
