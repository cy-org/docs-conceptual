# Implementing retries with exponential backoff

[*Retries with exponential backoff*](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) is a technique that attempts to retry an operation, with an exponentially increasing wait time, until a maximum retry count has been reached (the [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)). This technique embraces the fact that cloud resources might intermittently be unavailable for more than a few seconds for any reason. For example, an orchestrator might be moving a container to another node in a cluster for load balancing. During that time, some requests might fail. Another example could be a database like SQL Azure, where a database can be moved to another server for load balancing, causing the database to be unavailable for a few seconds.

There are many approaches to implement retries logic with exponential backoff.
