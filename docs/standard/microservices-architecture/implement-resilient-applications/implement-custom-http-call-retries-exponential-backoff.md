# Implementing custom HTTP call retries with exponential backoff

In order to create resilient microservices, you need to handle possible HTTP failure scenarios. For that purpose, you could create your own implementation of retries with exponential backoff.

In addition to handling temporal resource unavailability, the exponential backoff also needs to take into account that the cloud provider might throttle availability of resources to prevent usage overload. For example, creating too many connection requests very quickly might be viewed as a Denial of Service ([DoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)) attack by the cloud provider. As a result, you need to provide a mechanism to scale back connection requests when a capacity threshold has been encountered.

As an initial exploration, you could implement your own code with a utility class for exponential backoff as in [RetryWithExponentialBackoff.cs](https://gist.github.com/CESARDELATORRE/6d7f647b29e55fdc219ee1fd2babb260), plus code like the following (which is also available on a [GitHub repo](https://gist.github.com/CESARDELATORRE/d80c6423a1aebaffaf387469f5194f5b)).

```csharp
public sealed class RetryWithExponentialBackoff
{
    private readonly int maxRetries, delayMilliseconds, maxDelayMilliseconds;

    public RetryWithExponentialBackoff(int maxRetries = 50,
        int delayMilliseconds = 200,
        int maxDelayMilliseconds = 2000)
    {
        this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
        this.delayMilliseconds = delayMilliseconds;
        this.maxDelayMilliseconds = maxDelayMilliseconds;
    }

    public async Task RunAsync(Func<Task> func)
    {
        ExponentialBackoff backoff = new ExponentialBackoff(this.maxRetries,
            this.delayMilliseconds,
            this.maxDelayMilliseconds);
        retry:
        try
        {
            await func();
        }
        catch (Exception ex) when (ex is TimeoutException ||
            ex is System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Exception raised is: " +
                ex.GetType().ToString() +
                " â€“Message: " + ex.Message +
                " -- Inner Message: " +
                ex.InnerException.Message);
            await backoff.Delay();
            goto retry;
        }
    }
}

public struct ExponentialBackoff
{
    private readonly int m_maxRetries, m_delayMilliseconds, m_maxDelayMilliseconds;
    private int m_retries, m_pow;

    public ExponentialBackoff(int maxRetries, int delayMilliseconds,
        int maxDelayMilliseconds)
    {
        m_maxRetries = maxRetries;
        m_delayMilliseconds = delayMilliseconds;
        m_maxDelayMilliseconds = maxDelayMilliseconds;
        m_retries = 0;
        m_pow = 1;
    }

    public Task Delay()
    {
        if (m_retries == m_maxRetries)
        {
            throw new TimeoutException("Max retry attempts exceeded.");
        }
        ++m_retries;
        if (m_retries < 31)
        {
            m_pow = m_pow << 1; // m_pow = Pow(2, m_retries - 1)
        }
        int delay = Math.Min(m_delayMilliseconds * (m_pow - 1) / 2,
            m_maxDelayMilliseconds);
        return Task.Delay(delay);
    }
}
```

Using this code in a client C\# application (another Web API client microservice, an ASP.NET MVC application, or even a C\# Xamarin application) is straightforward. The following example shows how, using the HttpClient class.

```csharp
public async Task<Catalog> GetCatalogItems(int page,int take, int? brand, int? type)
{
    _apiClient = new HttpClient();
    var itemsQs = $"items?pageIndex={page}&pageSize={take}";
    var filterQs = "";
    var catalogUrl = $"{_remoteServiceBaseUrl}items{filterQs}?pageIndex={page}&pageSize={take}";
    var dataString = "";
    //
    // Using HttpClient with Retry and Exponential Backoff
    //
    var retry = new RetryWithExponentialBackoff();
    await retry.RunAsync(async () =>
    {
        // work with HttpClient call
        dataString = await _apiClient.GetStringAsync(catalogUrl);
    });
    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Catalog>(dataString);
}
```

However, this code is suitable only as a proof of concept. The next topic explains how to use more sophisticated and proven libraries.
