# Implementing HTTP call retries with exponential backoff with Polly

The recommended approach for retries with exponential backoff is to take advantage of more advanced .NET libraries like the open source [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) library.

Polly is a .NET library that provides resilience and transient-fault handling capabilities. You can implement those capabilities easily by applying Polly policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead Isolation, Timeout, and Fallback. Polly targets .NET 4.x and the .NET Standard version 1.0 (which supports .NET Core).

The Retry policy in Polly is the approach used in eShopOnContainers when implementing HTTP retries. You can implement an interface so you can inject either standard HttpClient functionality or a resilient version of HttpClient using Polly, depending on what retry policy configuration you want to use.

The following example shows the interface implemented in eShopOnContainers.

```csharp
public interface IHttpClient
{
    Task<string> GetStringAsync(string uri, string authorizationToken = null,
        string authorizationMethod = "Bearer");
        Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostAsync<T>(string uri, T item,
        string authorizationToken = null, string requestId = null,
        string authorizationMethod = "Bearer");

    Task<HttpResponseMessage> DeleteAsync(string uri,
        string authorizationToken = null, string requestId = null,
        string authorizationMethod = "Bearer");

    // Other methods ...
}
```

You can use the standard implementation if you do not want to use a resilient mechanism, as when you are developing or testing simpler approaches. The following code shows the standard HttpClient implementation allowing requests with authentication tokens as an optional case.

```csharp
public class StandardHttpClient : IHttpClient
{
    private HttpClient _client;
    private ILogger<StandardHttpClient> _logger;

    public StandardHttpClient(ILogger<StandardHttpClient> logger)
    {
        _client = new HttpClient();
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetStringAsync(string uri,
        string authorizationToken = null,
        string authorizationMethod = "Bearer")
    {
        var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, uri);
        if (authorizationToken != null)
        {
            requestMessage.Headers.Authorization =
                new AuthenticationHeaderValue(authorizationMethod, authorizationToken);
        }
        var response = await _client.SendAsync(requestMessage);
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }

    public async Task<HttpResponseMessage> PostAsync<T>(string uri, T item,
        string authorizationToken = null, string requestId = null,
        string authorizationMethod = "Bearer")
    {
        // Rest of the code and other Http methods ...
```

The interesting implementation is to code another, similar class, but using Polly to implement the resilient mechanisms you want to useâ€”in the following example, retries with exponential backoff.

```csharp
public class ResilientHttpClient : IHttpClient
{
    private HttpClient _client;
    private PolicyWrap _policyWrapper;
    private ILogger<ResilientHttpClient> _logger;

    public ResilientHttpClient(Policy[] policies,
        ILogger<ResilientHttpClient> logger)
    {
        _client = new HttpClient();
        _logger = logger;
        // Add Policies to be applied
        _policyWrapper = Policy.WrapAsync(policies);
    }

    private Task<T> HttpInvoker<T>(Func<Task<T>> action)
    {
        // Executes the action applying all
        // the policies defined in the wrapper
        return _policyWrapper.ExecuteAsync(() => action());
    }

    public Task<string> GetStringAsync(string uri,
        string authorizationToken = null,
        string authorizationMethod = "Bearer")
    {
        return HttpInvoker(async () =>
        {
            var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, uri);
            // The Token's related code eliminated for clarity in code snippet
            var response = await _client.SendAsync(requestMessage);
            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        });
    }
    // Other Http methods executed through HttpInvoker so it applies Polly policies
    // ...
}
```

With Polly, you define a Retry policy with the number of retries, the exponential backoff configuration, and the actions to take when there is an HTTP exception, such as logging the error. In this case, the policy is configured so it will try the number of times specified when registering the types in the IoC container. Because of the exponential backoff configuration, whenever the code detects an HttpRequest exception, it retries the Http request after waiting an amount of time that increases exponentially depending on how the policy was configured.

The important method is HttpInvoker, which is what makes HTTP requests throughout this utility class. That method internally executes the HTTP request with \_policyWrapper.ExecuteAsync, which takes into account the retry policy.

In eShopOnContainers you specify Polly policies when registering the types at the IoC container, as in the following code from the [MVC web app at the startup.cs](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/master/src/Web/WebMVC/Startup.cs) class.

```csharp
// Startup.cs class
if (Configuration.GetValue<string>("UseResilientHttp") == bool.TrueString)
{
    services.AddTransient<IResilientHttpClientFactory,
        ResilientHttpClientFactory>();
    services.AddSingleton<IHttpClient,
        ResilientHttpClient>(sp =>
            sp.GetService<IResilientHttpClientFactory>().
            CreateResilientHttpClient());
}
else
{
    services.AddSingleton<IHttpClient, StandardHttpClient>();
}
```

Note that the IHttpClient objects are instantiated as singleton instead of as transient so that TCP connections are used efficiently by the service and [an issue with sockets](https://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/08/2016-08-27-httpclientwrong/) will not occur.

But the important point about resiliency is that you apply the Polly WaitAndRetryAsync policy within ResilientHttpClientFactory in the CreateResilientHttpClient method, as shown in the following code:

```csharp
public ResilientHttpClient CreateResilientHttpClient()
    => new ResilientHttpClient(CreatePolicies(), _logger);

// Other code
private Policy[] CreatePolicies()
    => new Policy[]
    {
        Policy.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .WaitAndRetryAsync(
        // number of retries
        6,
        // exponential backoff
        retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retryAttempt)),
        // on retry
        (exception, timeSpan, retryCount, context) =>
        {
            var msg = $"Retry {retryCount} implemented with Pollys RetryPolicy " +
            $"of {context.PolicyKey} " +
            $"at {context.ExecutionKey}, " +
            $"due to: {exception}.";
            _logger.LogWarning(msg);
            _logger.LogDebug(msg);
        }),
    }
```
