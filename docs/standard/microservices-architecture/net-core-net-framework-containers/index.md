# Choosing Between .NET Core and .NET Framework for Docker Containers

There are two supported implementations for building server-side containerized Docker applications with .NET: [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/framework) and [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). They share many .NET Standard components, and you can share code across the two. However, there are fundamental differences between them, and which implementation you use will depend on what you want to accomplish. This section provides guidance on when to choose each implementation.
