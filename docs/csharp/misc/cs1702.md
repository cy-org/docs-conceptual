# Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1702
Assuming assembly reference "Assembly Name #1" matches "Assembly Name #2", you may need to supply runtime policy  
  
 The two assembly references have differing build and/or revision numbers, so will not automatically unify. You may need to supply run-time policy to force unification by using directives in the application .config file.
