# Compiler Error CS0262
Partial declarations of 'type' have conflicting accessibility modifiers  
  
 This error occurs if a partial type has inconsistent modifiers such as public, private, protected, internal, or abstract. These modifiers must be consistent in all partial declarations for that type. For more information, see [Partial Classes and Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0262:  
  
```  
// CS0262.cs  
class A  
{  
    public partial class C  // CS0262  
    {  
    }  
    private partial class C  
    {  
    }  
}  
```
