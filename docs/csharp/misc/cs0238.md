# Compiler Error CS0238
'member' cannot be sealed because it is not an override  
  
 [sealed](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed.md) was used on a member that was not also marked with [override](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/override.md). For more information, see [Inheritance](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0238:  
  
```  
// CS0238.cs  
abstract class MyClass  
{  
   public abstract void f();  
}  
  
class MyClass2 : MyClass  
{  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
  
   public sealed void f() // CS0238  
   // Try the following definition instead:  
   // public override sealed void f()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
