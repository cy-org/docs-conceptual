# Compiler Error CS0118
'construct1_name' is a 'construct1' but is used like a 'construct2'  
  
 The compiler detected a situation in which a construct was used in some erroneous way or a disallowed operation was tried on a construct. Some common examples include the following:  
  
-   A try to instantiate a namespace (instead of a class)  
  
-   A try to call a field (instead of a method)  
  
-   A try to use a type as a variable  
  
-   A try to use an extern alias as a type.  
  
 To resolve this error, make sure that the operation you are performing is valid for the type you are performing the operation on.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0118.  
  
```  
// CS0118.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
namespace MyNamespace  
{  
   class MyClass  
   {  
      // MyNamespace not a class  
      MyNamespace ix = new MyNamespace ();   // CS0118  
   }  
}  
```
