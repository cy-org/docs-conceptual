# Compiler Error CS1939
Cannot pass the range variable 'name' as an out or ref parameter.  
  
 A range variable is a read-only variable that is introduced in a query expression and serves as an identifier for each successive element in a source sequence. Because it cannot be modified in any way, there is no point in passing it by `ref` or `out`. Therefore, both operations are not valid.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Pass the range variable by value.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates CS1939:  
  
```  
// cs1939.cs  
using System.Linq;  
class Test  
{  
    public static void F(ref int i)  
    {  
    }  
    public static void Main()  
    {  
        var list = new int[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
        var q = from x in list  
                let k = x  
                select Test.F(ref x); // CS1939  
    }  
}  
```
