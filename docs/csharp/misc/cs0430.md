# Compiler Error CS0430
The extern alias 'alias' was not specified in a /reference option  
  
 This error occurs when extern Alias is encountered but Alias was not specified as a reference on the command line. To resolve CS0430, compile with **/reference**.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
// CS0430_a.cs  
// compile with: /target:library   
public class MyClass {}  
```  
  
## Example  
 Compiling with **/reference:MyType=cs0430_a.dll** to refer to the DLL created in the previous sample resolves this error. The following sample generates CS0430.  
  
```  
// CS0430_b.cs  
extern alias MyType;   // CS0430  
public class Test   
{  
   public static void Main() {}  
}  
```
