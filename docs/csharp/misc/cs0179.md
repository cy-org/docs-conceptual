# Compiler Error CS0179
'member' cannot be extern and declare a body  
  
 When a class member is marked [extern](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/extern.md), it means that the member's definition is located in another file. Therefore, a class member marked as **extern** cannot be defined in the class. Either remove the `extern` keyword or delete the definition. For more information, see [Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md).  
  
 The following sample generates CS0179:  
  
```  
// CS0179.cs  
public class MyClass  
{  
   public extern int ExternMethod(int aa)   // CS0179  
   {  
      return 0;  
   }  
   // try the following line instead  
   // public extern int ExternMethod(int aa);  
  
   public static void Main()  
   {  
   }  
}  
```
