# Compiler Error CS0578
The Conditional attribute is not valid on 'function' because its return type is not void  
  
 <xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute> cannot be applied to a method that has a return type other than `void`. The reason for this is that any other return type for a method may be needed by another part of your program.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates CS0578. To resolve this error, you must either delete <xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute>, or you must change the return value of the method to `void`.  
  
```  
// CS0578.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public class MyClass  
{  
   [System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute("a")]   // CS0578  
   public int TestMethod()  
   {  
      return 0;  
   }  
}  
```
