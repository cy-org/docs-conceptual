# C# Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 This section contains links to C# programming walkthroughs.  
  
## In This Section  

 [Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](./programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [async](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) and [await](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md).  
  
 [Creating a Windows Runtime Component in C# or Visual Basic and Calling it from JavaScript](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh779077.aspx)  
 Shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[wrt](~/includes/wrt-md.md)] type, package it in a [!INCLUDE[wrt](~/includes/wrt-md.md)] component, and then call the component from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](~/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.  
  
 [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/interop/walkthrough-office-programming.md)  
 Shows how to create an Excel workbook and a Word document by using C# and Visual Basic.  
  
 [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](../csharp/programming-guide/types/walkthrough-creating-and-using-dynamic-objects.md)  
 Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the `IronPython` library.  
   
 [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a6h7e207.aspx)
