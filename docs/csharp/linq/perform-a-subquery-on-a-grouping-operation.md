# Perform a subquery on a grouping operation

This topic shows two different ways to create a query that orders the source data into groups, and then performs a subquery over each group individually. The basic technique in each example is to group the source elements by using a *continuation* named `newGroup`, and then generating a new subquery against `newGroup`. This subquery is run against each new group that is created by the outer query. Note that in this particular example the final output is not a group, but a flat sequence of anonymous types.  
  
 For more information about how to group, see [group clause](../language-reference/keywords/group-clause.md).  
  
 For more information about continuations, see [into](../language-reference/keywords/into.md). The following example uses an in-memory data structure as the data source, but the same principles apply for any kind of LINQ data source.  
  
## Example 

 > [!NOTE]
 > This example contains references to objects that are defined in the sample code in [Query a collection of objects](query-a-collection-of-objects.md).
