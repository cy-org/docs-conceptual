# Handle exceptions in query expressions

It is possible to call any method in the context of a query expression. However, we recommend that you avoid calling any method in a query expression that can create a side effect such as modifying the contents of the data source or throwing an exception. This example shows how to avoid raising exceptions when you call methods in a query expression without violating the general .NET Framework guidelines on exception handling. Those guidelines state that it is acceptable to catch a specific exception when you understand why it will be thrown in a given context. For more information, see [Best Practices for Exceptions](../../standard/exceptions/best-practices-for-exceptions.md).  
  
 The final example shows how to handle those cases when you must throw an exception during execution of a query.  
  
## Example  

 The following example shows how to move exception handling code outside a query expression. This is only possible when the method does not depend on any variables local to the query.

## Example 

 In some cases, the best response to an exception that is thrown from within a query might be to stop the query execution immediately. The following example shows how to handle exceptions that might be thrown from inside a query body. Assume that `SomeMethodThatMightThrow` can potentially cause an exception that requires the query execution to stop.  
  
 Note that the `try` block encloses the `foreach` loop, and not the query itself. This is because the `foreach` loop is the point at which the query is actually executed. For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ queries](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).
