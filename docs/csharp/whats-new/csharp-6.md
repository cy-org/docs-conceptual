# What's New in C# 6

The 6.0 release of C# contained many features that improve
productivity for developers. Features in this release include:

* [Read-only Auto-properties](#read-only-auto-properties):
    - You can create read-only auto-properties that can be set only in constructors.
* [Auto-Property Initializers](#auto-property-initializers):
    - You can write initialization expressions to set the initial value of an auto-property.
* [Expression-bodied function members](#expression-bodied-function-members):
    - You can author one-line methods using lambda expressions.
* [using static](#using-static):
    - You can import all the methods of a single class into the current namespace.
* [Null - conditional operators](#null-conditional-operators):
    - You can concisely and safely access members of an object while still checking for null with the null conditional operator.
* [String Interpolation](#string-interpolation):
    - You can write string formatting expressions using inline expressions instead of positional arguments.
* [Exception filters](#exception-filters):
    - You can catch expressions based on properties of the exception or other program state. 
* [nameof Expressions](#nameof-expressions):
    - You can let the compiler generate string representations of symbols.
* [await in catch and finally blocks](#await-in-catch-and-finally-blocks):
    - You can use `await` expressions in locations that previously disallowed them.
* [index initializers](#index-initializers):
    - You can author initialization expressions for associative containers as well as sequence containers.
* [Extension methods for collection initializers](#extension-add-methods-in-collection-initializers):
    - Collection initializers can rely on accessible extension methods, in addition to member methods.
* [Improved overload resolution](#improved-overload-resolution):
    - Some constructs that previously generated ambiguous method calls now resolve correctly.

The overall effect of these features is that you write more concise code
that is also more readable. The syntax contains less ceremony for many
common practices. It's easier to see the design intent with less
ceremony. Learn these features well, and you'll be more productive,
write more readable code, and concentrate more on your core features
than on the constructs of the language.

The remainder of this topic provides details on each of these features.

## Auto-Property enhancements 

The syntax for automatically implemented properties (usually referred to as 'auto-properties')
made it very easy to create properties
that had simple get and set accessors:

[!code-csharp[ClassicAutoProperty](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/oldcode.cs#ClassicAutoProperty)]

However, this simple syntax limited the kinds of designs you could support using
auto-properties. C# 6 improves the auto-properties capabilities so that you can use
them in more scenarios. You won't need to fall back on the more verbose syntax of
declaring and manipulating the backing field by hand so often.

The new syntax addresses scenarios for read-only properties, and for initializing
the variable storage behind an auto-property.

### Read-only auto-properties

*Read-only auto-properties* provide a more concise syntax to create
immutable types. The closest you could get to immutable types
in earlier versions of C# was to declare private setters:

[!code-csharp[ClassicReadOnlyAutoProperty](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/oldcode.cs#ClassicReadOnlyAutoProperty)]
 
Using this syntax, the compiler doesn't ensure that the type really is immutable. It only
enforces that the `FirstName` and `LastName` properties are not modified from any
code outside the class.

Read-only auto-properties enable true read-only behavior. You declare the auto-property
with only a get accessor:

[!code-csharp[ReadOnlyAutoProperty](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#ReadOnlyAutoProperty)]

The `FirstName` and `LastName` properties can be set only in the body of a constructor:

[!code-csharp[ReadOnlyAutoPropertyConstructor](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#ReadOnlyAutoPropertyConstructor)]

Trying to set `LastName` in another method generates a `CS0200` compilation error:

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public string LastName { get;  }

    public void ChangeName(string newLastName)
    {
        // Generates CS0200: Property or indexer cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
        LastName = newLastName;
    }
}
```

This feature enables true language support for creating immutable types and using
the more concise and convenient auto-property syntax.

### Auto-Property Initializers

*Auto-Property Initializers* let you declare the initial value for
an auto-property as part of the property declaration.  In earlier versions,
these properties would need to have setters and you would need
to use that setter to initialize the data storage used by the backing
field. Consider this class for a student that contains the name and a
list of the student's grades:

[!code-csharp[Construction](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/oldcode.cs#Construction)]
 
As this class grows, you may include other constructors. Each constructor
needs to initialize this field, or you'll introduce errors.

C# 6 enables you to assign an initial value for the storage used by an
auto-property in the auto-property declaration:

[!code-csharp[Initialization](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#Initialization)]

The `Grades` member is initialized where it is declared. That makes it
easier to perform the initialization exactly once. The initialization
is part of the property declaration, making it easier to equate the
storage allocation with public interface for `Student` objects.

Property Initializers can be used with read/write properties as well
as read-only properties, as shown here.

[!code-csharp[ReadWriteInitialization](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#ReadWriteInitialization)]

## Expression-bodied function members

The body of a lot of members that we write consist of only one statement
that can be represented as an expression. You can reduce that syntax by
writing an expression-bodied member instead. It works for methods and
read-only properties. For example, an override of `ToString()` is often
a great candidate:

[!code-csharp[ToStringExpressionMember](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#ToStringExpressionMember)]

You can also use expression-bodied members in read-only properties as well:

[!code-csharp[FullNameExpressionMember](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#FullNameExpressionMember)]

## using static

The *using static* enhancement enables you to import the static methods
of a single class. Previously, the `using` statement imported all types
in a namespace. 

Often we use a class' static methods throughout our code. Repeatedly
typing the class name can obscure the meaning of your code. A common
example is when you write classes that perform many numeric calculations.
Your code will be littered with @System.Math.Sin, @System.Math.Sqrt and other calls
to different methods in the @System.Math class. The new `using static` syntax can make these
classes much cleaner to read. You specify the class you're using:

[!code-csharp[UsingStaticMath](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#UsingStaticMath)]

And now, you can use any static method in the @System.Math class without
qualifying the @System.Math class. The @System.Math class is a great use case for
this feature because it does not contain any
instance methods. You can also use `using static` to import a
class' static methods for a class that has both static
and instance methods. One of the most useful examples is @System.String:

[!code-csharp[UsingStatic](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#UsingStatic)]

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the fully qualified class name, `System.String`
> in a static using statement. 
> You cannot use the `string` keyword instead. 

You can now call static methods defined in the @System.String class without
qualifying those methods as members of that class:

[!code-csharp[UsingStaticString](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#UsingStaticString)]

The `static using` feature and extension methods interact in
interesting ways, and the language design included some rules
that specifically address those interactions. The goal is to
minimize any chances of breaking changes in existing codebases,
including yours.

Extension methods are only in scope when called using the
extension method invocation syntax, not when called as a static method.
You'll often see this in LINQ queries. You can import the LINQ pattern
by importing @System.Linq.Enumerable. 

[!code-csharp[UsingStaticLinq](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#usingStaticLinq)]

This imports all the methods in the @System.Linq.Enumerable class.
However, the extension methods are only in scope when called as extension
methods. They are not in scope if they are called using the static method
syntax:

[!code-csharp[UsingStaticLinqMethod](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#UsingStaticLinkMethod)]

This decision is because extension methods are typically called using
extension method invocation expressions. In the rare case where they are
called using the static method call syntax it is to resolve ambiguity.
Requiring the class name as part of the invocation seems wise.

There's one last feature of `static using`. The `static using` directive
also imports any nested types. That enables you to reference any nested
types without qualification.

## Null-conditional operators

Null values complicate code. You need to check every access
of variables to ensure you are not dereferencing `null`. The
*null conditional operator* makes those checks much easier
and fluid.

Simply replace the member access `.` with `?.`:

[!code-csharp[NullConditional](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/program.cs#NullConditional)]

In the preceding example, the variable `first` is assigned `null` if the person object
is `null`. Otherwise, it gets assigned the value of the `FirstName` property. Most importantly,
the `?.` means that this line of code does not generate a `NullReferenceException` when
the `person` variable is `null`. Instead, it short-circuits and produces `null`.

Also, note that this expression returns a `string`, regardless of the value of `person`.
In the case of short circuiting, the `null` value returned is typed to match the full
expression.

You can often use this construct with the *null coalescing* operator to assign
default values when one of the properties are `null`:

[!code-csharp[NullCoalescing](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/program.cs#NullCoalescing)]

The right hand side operand of the `?.` operator is not limited to properties or fields.
You can also use it to conditionally invoke methods. The most common use of member functions
 with the null conditional operator is to safely invoke delegates
(or event handlers) that may be `null`.  You'll do this by calling the delegate's `Invoke` method
using the `?.` operator to access the member. You can see an example in the  
[delegate patterns](../delegates-patterns.md#handling-null-delegates) topic.

The rules of the `?.` operator ensure that the left-hand side of the operator is
evaluated only once. This is important and enables many idioms, including the
example using event handlers. Let's start with the event handler usage. In previous
versions of C#, you were encouraged to write code like this:

```csharp
var handler = this.SomethingHappened;
if (handler != null)
    handler(this, eventArgs);
```

This was preferred over a simpler syntax:

```csharp
// Not recommended
if (this.SomethingHappened != null)
    this.SomethingHappened(this, eventArgs);
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The preceding example introduces a race condition. The `SomethingHappened`
> event may have subscribers when checked against `null`, and those subscribers
> may have been removed before the event is raised. That would cause 
> a @System.NullReferenceException to be thrown.

In this second version, the `SomethingHappened` event handler might
be non-null when tested, but if other code removes a handler,
it could still be null when the event handler was called.

The compiler generates code for the `?.` operator that ensures
the left side (`this.SomethingHappened`) of the `?.` expression is evaluated once, and the result
is cached:

```csharp
// preferred in C# 6:
this.SomethingHappened?.Invoke(this, eventArgs);
```

Ensuring that the left side is evaluated only once also enables you
to use any expression, including method calls, on the left side of the
`?.` Even if these have side-effects, they are evaluated once, so the
side effects occur only once. You can see an example in our content
on [events](../events-overview.md#language-support-for-events).

## String Interpolation

C# 6 contains new syntax for composing strings from a format string
and expressions that can be evaluated to produce other string values.

Traditionally, you needed to use positional parameters in a method
like `string.Format`:

[!code-csharp[stringFormat](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/oldcode.cs#stringFormat)]

With C# 6, the new string interpolation feature enables you to embed
the expressions in the format string. Simple preface the string with
`$`:

[!code-csharp[stringInterpolation](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#FullNameExpressionMember)]

This initial example used variable expressions for the substituted
expressions. You can expand on this syntax to use any expression. For
example, you could compute a student's grade point average as part of
the interpolation:

[!code-csharp[stringInterpolationExpression](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#stringInterpolationExpression)]

Running the preceding example, you would find that the output for `Grades.Average()`
might have more decimal places than you would like. The string interpolation
syntax supports all the format strings available using earlier formatting
methods. You add the format strings inside the braces. Add a `:` following
the expression to format:

[!code-csharp[stringInterpolationFormat](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#stringInterpolationFormat)]

The preceding line of code will format the value for `Grades.Average()` as
a floating-point number with two decimal places.

The `:` is always interpreted as the separator between the expression
being formatted and the format string. This can introduce problems when
your expression uses a `:` in another way, such as a conditional operator:

```csharp
public string GetGradePointPercentages() =>
    $"Name: {LastName}, {FirstName}. G.P.A: {Grades.Any() ? Grades.Average() : double.NaN:F2}";
```

In the preceding example, the `:` is parsed as the beginning of the format string, not part
of the conditional operator. In all cases where this happens, you can
surround the expression with parentheses to force the compiler to interpret
the expression as you intend:

[!code-csharp[stringInterpolationConditional](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#stringInterpolationConditional)]

There aren't any limitations on the expressions you can place between
the braces. You can execute a complex LINQ query inside an interpolated
string to perform computations and display the result:

[!code-csharp[stringInterpolationLinq](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/newcode.cs#stringInterpolationLinq)]

You can see from this sample that you can even nest a string interpolation
expression inside another string interpolation expression. This example
is very likely more complex than you would want in production code.
Rather, it is illustrative of the breadth of the feature. Any C# expression
can be placed between the curly braces of an interpolated string.

### String interpolation and specific cultures

All the examples shown in the preceding section will format the strings using the current
culture and language on the machine where the code executes. Often you
may need to format the string produced using a specific culture.
The object produced from a string interpolation is a type that has an
implicit conversion to either @System.String or @System.FormattableString.

The @System.FormattableString type contains the format string, and the results
of evaluating the arguments before converting them to strings. You can
use public methods of @System.FormattableString to specify the culture when
formatting a string. For example, the following will produce a string
using German as the language and culture. (It will use the ',' character
for the decimal separator,
and the '.' character as the thousands separator.)

```csharp
FormattableString str = @"Average grade is {s.Grades.Average()}";
var gradeStr = string.Format(null, 
    System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture("de-de"),
    str.GetFormat(), str.GetArguments());
```

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding example is not supported in .NET Core version 1.0.1. It is
> only supported in the .NET Framework.

In general, string interpolation expressions produce strings as their
output. However, when you want greater control over the culture used to
format the string, you can specify a specific output.  If this is a capability
you often need, you can create convenience methods, as extension methods,
to enable easy formatting with specific cultures.

## Exception Filters

Another new feature in C# 6 is *exception filters*. Exception Filters
are clauses that determine when a given catch clause should be applied.
If the expression used for an exception filter evaluates to `true`, the
catch clause performs its normal processing on an exception. If the
expression evaluates to `false`, then the `catch` clause is skipped.

One use is to examine information about an exception to determine if a
`catch` clause can process the exception:

[!code-csharp[ExceptionFilter](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/NetworkClient.cs#ExceptionFilter)]

The code generated by exception filters provides better information about
an exception that is thrown and not processed. Before exception filters
were added to the language, you would need to create code like the following:

[!code-csharp[ExceptionFilterOld](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/NetworkClient.cs#ExceptionFilterOld)]

The point where the exception is thrown changes between these two examples.
In the previous code, where a `throw` clause is used, any stack trace
analysis or examination of crash dumps will show that the exception was
thrown from the `throw` statement in your catch clause. The actual exception
object will contain the original call stack, but all other information
about any variables in the call stack between this throw point and the
location of the original throw point has been lost. 

Contrast that with how the code using an exception filter is processed:
the exception filter expression evaluates to `false`. Therefore, execution never
enters the `catch` clause. Because the `catch` clause does not execute,
no stack unwinding takes place. That means the original
throw location is preserved for any debugging activities that would take
place later.

Whenever you need to evaluate fields or properties of an exception, instead
of relying solely on the exception type, use an exception filter to
preserve more debugging information.

Another recommended pattern with exception filters is to use them for
logging routines. This usage also leverages the manner in which the exception
throw point is preserved when an exception filter evaluates to `false`.

A logging method would be a method whose argument is the exception that
unconditionally returns `false`:

[!code-csharp[ExceptionFilterLogging](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/ExceptionFilterHelpers.cs#ExceptionFilterLogging)]

Whenever you want to log an exception, you can add a catch clause, and
use this method as the exception filter:

[!code-csharp[LogException](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/program.cs#LogException)]

The exceptions are never caught, because the `LogException` method always
returns `false`. That always false exception filter means that you can
place this logging handler before any other exception handlers:

[!code-csharp[LogExceptionRecovery](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/program.cs#LogExceptionRecovery)]

The preceding example highlights a very important facet of exception filters.
The exception filters enable scenarios where a more general exception
catch clause may appear before a more specific one. It's also possible
to have the same exception type appear in multiple catch clauses:

[!code-csharp[HandleNotChanged](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/NetworkClient.cs#HandleNotChanged)]

Another recommended pattern helps prevent catch clauses from processing
exceptions when a debugger is attached. This technique enables you to
run an application with the debugger, and stop execution when an exception
is thrown.

In your code, add an exception filter so that any recovery code executes
only when a debugger is not attached:

[!code-csharp[LogExceptionDebugger](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/program.cs#LogExceptionDebugger)]

After adding this in code, you set your debugger to break on all unhandled
exceptions. Run the program under the debugger, and the debugger breaks
whenever `PerformFailingOperation()` throws a `RecoverableException`.
The debugger breaks your program, because the catch clause won't be executed
due to the false-returning exception filter.

## `nameof` Expressions

The `nameof` expression evaluates to the name of a symbol. It's a great
way to get tools working whenever you need the name of a variable,
a property, or a member field.

One of the most common uses for `nameof` is to provide the name of a symbol
that caused an exception:

[!code-csharp[nameof](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/NewCode.cs#UsingStaticString)]

Another use is with XAML based applications that implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged`
interface:

[!code-csharp[nameofNotify](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/viewmodel.cs#nameofNotify)]

The advantage of using the `nameof` operator over a constant string is
that tools can understand the symbol. If you use refactoring tools to
rename the symbol, it will rename it in the `nameof` expression. Constant
strings don't have that advantage. Try it yourself in your favorite editor:
rename a variable, and any `nameof` expressions will update as well.

The `nameof` expression produces the unqualified name of its argument
(`LastName` in the previous examples) even if you use the fully qualified
name for the argument:

[!code-csharp[QualifiedNameofNotify](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/viewmodel.cs#QualifiedNameofNotify)]

This `nameof` expression produces `FirstName`, not `UXComponents.ViewModel.FirstName`.

## Await in Catch and Finally blocks

C# 5 had several limitations around where you could place `await` expressions.
One of those has been removed in C# 6. You can now use `await` in `catch`
or `finally` expressions. 

The addition of await expressions in catch and finally blocks may appear
to complicate how those are processed. Let's add an example to discuss
how this appears. In any async method, you can use an await expression
in a finally clause.

With C# 6, you can also await in catch expressions. This is most often
used with logging scenarios:

[!code-csharp[AwaitFinally](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/NetworkClient.cs#AwaitFinally)]

The implementation details for adding `await` support inside `catch`
and `finally` clauses ensures that the behavior is consistent with the
behavior for synchronous code. When code executed in a `catch` or `finally`
clause throws, execution looks for a suitable `catch` clause in the next
surrounding block. If there was a current exception, that exception is
lost. The same happens with awaited expressions in `catch` and `finally`
clauses: a suitable `catch` is searched for, and the current exception,
if any, is lost.  

> [!NOTE]
> This behavior is the reason it's recommended to write `catch` and `finally`
> clauses carefully, to avoid introducing new exceptions.

## Index Initializers

*Index Initializers* is one of two features that make collection
initializers more consistent. In earlier releases of C#, you could use
*collection initializers* only with sequence style collections:

[!code-csharp[ListInitializer](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/initializers.cs#ListInitializer)]

Now, you can also use them with @System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary collections and similar types:

[!code-csharp[DictionaryInitializer](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/initializers.cs#DictionaryInitializer)]

This feature means that associative containers can be initialized using
syntax similar to what's been in place for sequence containers for several
versions.

### Extension `Add` methods in collection initializers

Another feature that makes collection initialization easier is the ability
to use an *extension method* for the `Add` method. This feature was
added for parity with Visual Basic. 

The feature is most useful when you have a custom collection class that
has a method with a different name to semantically add new items.

For example, consider a collection of students like this:

[!code-csharp[Enrollment](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/enrollment.cs#Enrollment)]

The `Enroll` method adds a student. But it doesn't follow the `Add` pattern.
In previous versions of C#, you could not use collection initializers with an
`Enrollment` object:

[!code-csharp[InitializeEnrollment](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/classList.cs#InitializeEnrollment)]

Now you can, but only if you create an extension method that maps `Add` to
`Enroll`:

[!code-csharp[ExtensionAdd](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/classList.cs#ExtensionAdd)]

What you are doing with this feature is to map whatever method adds
items to a collection to a method named `Add` by creating an
extension method: 

[!code-csharp[Enrollment](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/enrollment.cs#Enrollment)]
[!code-csharp[ExtensionAddSample](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/classList.cs#ExtensionAddSample)]

## Improved overload resolution

This last feature is one you probably won't notice. There were constructs
where the previous version of the C# compiler may have found some method
calls involving lambda expressions ambiguous. Consider this method:

[!code-csharp[AsyncMethod](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/overloads.cs#AsyncMethod)]

In earlier versions of C#, calling that method using the method group
syntax would fail:

[!code-csharp[MethodGroup](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/overloads.cs#MethodGroup)]
 
The earlier compiler could not distinguish correctly between `Task.Run(Action)`
and `Task.Run(Func<Task>())`. In previous versions, you'd need to use
a lambda expression as an argument:

[!code-csharp[Lambda](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/overloads.cs#Lambda)]

The C# 6 compiler correctly determines that `Task.Run(Func<Task>())` is
a better choice.
