# C# Quick starts #

Welcome to the C# Quick starts. These start with interactive lessons
that you can run in your browser.

The first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code. You'll
learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings,
numbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing code
within minutes. These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of
programming or the C# language.

## [Hello world](hello-world)

In the [Hello world](hello-world) lesson, you'll create the most basic
C#. You'll explore the `string` type and how to work with text.

## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp)

In the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp) lesson, you'll learn
how computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different
number types. You'll learn the basics of rounding, and how to perform
mathematical calculations using C#.

This lesson assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world) tutorial.

## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops)

The [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops) lesson teaches the basics of selecting
different paths of code based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the
basics of control flow, which is the basics of how programs make decisions and choose
different actions.

This beginner lesson assumes that you have finished the [Hello World](hello-world) and
[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp) lessons.
