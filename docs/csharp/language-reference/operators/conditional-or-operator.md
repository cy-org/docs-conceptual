# || Operator (C# Reference)
The conditional-OR operator (`||`) performs a logical-OR of its `bool` operands. If the first operand evaluates to `true`, the second operand isn't evaluated. If the first operand evaluates to `false`, the second operator determines whether the OR expression as a whole evaluates to `true` or `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The operation  
  
```  
x || y  
```  
  
 corresponds to the operation  
  
```  
x | y  
```  
  
 except that if `x` is `true`, `y` is not evaluated because the OR operation is `true` regardless of the value of `y`. This concept is known as "short-circuit" evaluation.  
  
 The conditional-OR operator cannot be overloaded, but overloads of the regular logical operators and the [true](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/true.md) and [false](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/false.md) operators are, with certain restrictions, also considered to be overloads of the conditional logical operators.  
  
## Example  
 In the following examples, the expression that uses `||` evaluates only the first operand. The expression that uses `|` evaluates both operands. In the second example, a run-time exception occurs if both operands are evaluated.
