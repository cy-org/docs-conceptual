# ++ Operator (C# Reference)
The increment operator (`++`) increments its operand by 1. The increment operator can appear before or after its operand: `++variable` and `variable++`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The first form is a prefix increment operation. The result of the operation is the value of the operand after it has been incremented.  
  
 The second form is a postfix increment operation. The result of the operation is the value of the operand before it has been incremented.  
  
 Numeric and enumeration types have predefined increment operators. User-defined types can overload the `++` operator. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#3](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/increment-operator_1.cs)]
