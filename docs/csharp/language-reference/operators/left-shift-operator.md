# &lt;&lt; Operator (C# Reference)
The left-shift operator (`<<`) shifts its first operand left by the number of bits specified by its second operand. The type of the second operand must be an [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md) or a type that has a predefined implicit numeric conversion to `int`.  
  
## Remarks  
 If the first operand is an [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md) or [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md) (32-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of the second operand. That is, the actual shift count is 0 to 31 bits.  
  
 If the first operand is a [long](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/long.md) or [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md) (64-bit quantity), the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of the second operand. That is, the actual shift count is 0 to 63 bits.  
  
 Any high-order bits that are not within the range of the type of the first operand after the shift are discarded, and the low-order empty bits are zero-filled. Shift operations never cause overflows.  
  
 User-defined types can overload the `<<` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)); the type of the first operand must be the user-defined type, and the type of the second operand must be `int`. When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#14](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/left-shift-operator_1.cs)]  
  
## Comments  
 Note that `i<<1` and `i<<33` give the same result, because 1 and 33 have the same low-order five bits.
