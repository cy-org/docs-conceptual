# &lt;= Operator (C# Reference)
All numeric and enumeration types define a "less than or equal" relational operator (`<=`) that returns `true` if the first operand is less than or equal to the second, `false` otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `<=` operator. For more information, see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md). If `<=` is overloaded, [>=](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/greater-than-equal-operator.md) must also be overloaded. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#32](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/less-than-equal-operator_1.cs)]
