# &gt;= Operator (C# Reference)
All numeric and enumeration types define a "greater than or equal" relational operator, `>=` that returns `true` if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second, `false` otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `>=` operator. For more information, see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md). If `>=` is overloaded, [<=](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/less-than-equal-operator.md) must also be overloaded. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#39](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/greater-than-equal-operator_1.cs)]
