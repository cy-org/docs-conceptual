# () Operator (C# Reference)
In addition to being used to specify the order of operations in an expression, parentheses are used to perform the following tasks:  
  
1.  Specify casts, or type conversions.  
  
     [!code-cs[csRefOperators#1](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/invocation-operator_1.cs)]  
  
2.  Invoke methods or delegates.  
  
     [!code-cs[csRefOperators#2](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/invocation-operator_2.cs)]  
  
## Remarks  
 A cast explicitly invokes the conversion operator from one type to another; the cast fails if no such conversion operator is defined. To define a conversion operator, see [explicit](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/explicit.md) and [implicit](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/implicit.md).  
  
 The `()` operator cannot be overloaded.  
  
 For more information, see [Casting and Type Conversions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/casting-and-type-conversions.md).  
  
 A cast expression could lead to ambiguous syntax. For example, the expression `(x)–y` could be either interpreted as a cast expression (a cast of –y to type x) or as an additive expression combined with a parenthesized expression, which computes the value x – y.  
  
 For more information about method invocation, see [Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md).
