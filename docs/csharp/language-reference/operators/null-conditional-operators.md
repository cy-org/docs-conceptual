# Null-conditional Operators (C# and Visual Basic)
Used to test for null before performing a member access (`?.`) or index (`?[`) operation.  These operators help you write less code to handle null checks, especially for descending into data structures.  
  
```csharp  
int? length = customers?.Length; // null if customers is null   
Customer first = customers?[0];  // null if customers is null  
int? count = customers?[0]?.Orders?.Count();  // null if customers, the first customer, or Orders is null  
```  
  
```vb  
Dim length = customers?.Length  ' null if customers is null  
Dim first as Customer = customers?(0)  ' null if customers is null  
Dim count as Integer? = customers?(0)?.Orders?.Count()  ' null if customers, the first customer, or Orders is null  
```  
  
 The last example demonstrates that the null-condition operators are short-circuiting.  If one operation in a chain of conditional member access and index operation returns null, then the rest of the chain’s execution stops.  Other operations with lower precedence in the expression continue.  For example, `E` in the following executes in the second line, and the `??` and `==` operations execute.  In the first line, the `??` short circuits and `E` does not execute when the left side evaluates to non-null.
  
```csharp
A?.B?.C?[0] ?? E  
A?.B?.C?[0] == E  
```

```vb
A?.B?.C?(0) ?? E  
A?.B?.C?(0) == E  
```  
  
 Another use for the null-condition member access is invoking delegates in a thread-safe way with much less code.  The old way requires code like the following:  
  
```csharp  
var handler = this.PropertyChanged;  
if (handler != null)  
    handler(…);
```  
  
```vb  
Dim handler = AddressOf(Me.PropertyChanged)  
If handler IsNot Nothing  
    Call handler(…)  
```  
  
 The new way is much simpler:  
  
```csharp
PropertyChanged?.Invoke(e)  
```  

```vb
PropertyChanged?.Invoke(e)
```  
  
 The new way is thread-safe because the compiler generates code to evaluate `PropertyChanged` one time only, keeping the result in a temporary variable.  
  
 You need to explicitly call the `Invoke` method because there is no null-conditional delegate invocation syntax `PropertyChanged?(e)`.  There were too many ambiguous parsing situations to allow it.
