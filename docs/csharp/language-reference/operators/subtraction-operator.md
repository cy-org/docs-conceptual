# - Operator (C# Reference)
The `-` operator can function as either a unary or a binary operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 Unary `-` operators are predefined for all numeric types. The result of a unary `-` operation on a numeric type is the numeric negation of the operand.  
  
 Binary `-` operators are predefined for all numeric and enumeration types to subtract the second operand from the first.  
  
 Delegate types also provide a binary `-` operator, which performs delegate removal.  
  
 User-defined types can overload the unary `-` and binary `-` operators. For more information, see [operator (C# Reference)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#40](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/subtraction-operator_1.cs)]
