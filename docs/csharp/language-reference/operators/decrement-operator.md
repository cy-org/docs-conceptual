# -- Operator (C# Reference)
The decrement operator (`--`) decrements its operand by 1. The decrement operator can appear before or after its operand: `--variable` and `variable--`. The first form is a prefix decrement operation. The result of the operation is the value of the operand "after" it has been decremented. The second form is a postfix decrement operation. The result of the operation is the value of the operand "before" it has been decremented.  
  
## Remarks  
 Numeric and enumeration types have predefined decrement operators.  
  
 User-defined types can overload the `--` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#8](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/decrement-operator_1.cs)]
