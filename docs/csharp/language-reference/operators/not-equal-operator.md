# != Operator (C# Reference)
The inequality operator (`!=`) returns false if its operands are equal, true otherwise. Inequality operators are predefined for all types, including string and object. User-defined types can overload the `!=` operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 For predefined value types, the inequality operator (`!=`) returns true if the values of its operands are different, false otherwise. For reference types other than `string`, `!=` returns true if its two operands refer to different objects. For the `string` type, `!=` compares the values of the strings.  
  
 User-defined value types can overload the `!=` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). So can user-defined reference types, although by default `!=` behaves as described above for both predefined and user-defined reference types. If `!=` is overloaded, [==](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-comparison-operator.md) must also be overloaded. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#33](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/not-equal-operator_1.cs)]
