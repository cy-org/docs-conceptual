# | Operator (C# Reference)
Binary `|` operators are predefined for the integral types and `bool`. For integral types, `|` computes the bitwise OR of its operands. For `bool` operands, `|` computes the logical OR of its operands; that is, the result is `false` if and only if both its operands are `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `|` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#31](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/or-operator_1.cs)]
