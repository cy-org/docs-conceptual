# &amp;&amp; Operator (C# Reference)
The conditional-AND operator (`&&`) performs a logical-AND of its `bool` operands, but only evaluates its second operand if necessary.  
  
## Remarks  
 The operation  
  
```  
x && y  
```  
  
 corresponds to the operation  
  
```  
x & y  
```  
  
 except that if `x` is `false`, `y` is not evaluated, because the result of the AND operation is `false` no matter what the value of `y`  is. This is known as "short-circuit" evaluation.  
  
 The conditional-AND operator cannot be overloaded, but overloads of the regular logical operators and operators [true](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/true.md) and [false](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/false.md) are, with certain restrictions, also considered overloads of the conditional logical operators.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, the conditional expression in the second `if` statement evaluates only the first operand because the operand returns `false`.
