# == Operator (C# Reference)
For predefined value types, the equality operator (`==`) returns true if the values of its operands are equal, `false` otherwise. For reference types other than [string](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/string.md), `==` returns `true` if its two operands refer to the same object. For the `string` type, `==` compares the values of the strings.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined value types can overload the `==` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). So can user-defined reference types, although by default `==` behaves as described above for both predefined and user-defined reference types. If `==` is overloaded, [!=](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/not-equal-operator.md) must also be overloaded. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#36](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/equality-comparison-operator_1.cs)]
