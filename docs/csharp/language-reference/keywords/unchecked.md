# unchecked (C# Reference)
The `unchecked` keyword is used to suppress overflow-checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.  
  
 In an unchecked context, if an expression produces a value that is outside the range of the destination type, the overflow is not flagged. For example, because the calculation in the following example is performed in an `unchecked` block or expression, the fact that the result is too large for an integer is ignored, and `int1` is assigned the value -2,147,483,639.  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsChecked#5](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/unchecked_1.cs)]  
  
 If the `unchecked` environment is removed, a compilation error occurs. The overflow can be detected at compile time because all the terms of the expression are constants.  
  
 Expressions that contain non-constant terms are unchecked by default at compile time and run time. See [checked](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked.md) for information about enabling a checked environment.  
  
 Because checking for overflow takes time, the use of unchecked code in situations where there is no danger of overflow might improve performance. However, if overflow is a possibility, a checked environment should be used.  
  
## Example  
 This sample shows how to use the `unchecked` keyword.
