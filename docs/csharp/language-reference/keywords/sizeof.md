# sizeof (C# Reference)
Used to obtain the size in bytes for an unmanaged type. Unmanaged types include the built-in types that are listed in the table that follows, and also the following:  
  
-   Enum types  
  
-   Pointer types  
  
-   User-defined structs that do not contain any fields or properties that are reference types  
  
 The following example shows how to retrieve the size of an `int`:  
  
```csharp  
// Constant value 4:  
int intSize = sizeof(int);   
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Starting with version 2.0 of C#, applying `sizeof` to built-in types no longer requires that [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) mode be used.  
  
 The `sizeof` operator cannot be overloaded. The values returned by the `sizeof` operator are of type `int`. The following table shows the constant values that are substituted for `sizeof` expressions that have certain built-in types as operands.  
  
|Expression|Constant value|  
|----------------|--------------------|  
|`sizeof(sbyte)`|1|  
|`sizeof(byte)`|1|  
|`sizeof(short)`|2|  
|`sizeof(ushort)`|2|  
|`sizeof(int)`|4|  
|`sizeof(uint)`|4|  
|`sizeof(long)`|8|  
|`sizeof(ulong)`|8|  
|`sizeof(char)`|2 (Unicode)|  
|`sizeof(float)`|4|  
|`sizeof(double)`|8|  
|`sizeof(decimal)`|16|  
|`sizeof(bool)`|1|  
  
 For all other types, including structs, the `sizeof` operator can be used only in unsafe code blocks. Although you can use the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, the value returned by this method is not always the same as the value returned by `sizeof`. <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName> returns the size after the type has been marshaled, whereas `sizeof` returns the size as it has been allocated by the common language runtime, including any padding.
