# unsafe (C# Reference)
The `unsafe` keyword denotes an unsafe context, which is required for any operation involving pointers. For more information, see [Unsafe Code and Pointers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/index.md).  
  
 You can use the `unsafe` modifier in the declaration of a type or a member. The entire textual extent of the type or member is therefore considered an unsafe context. For example, the following is a method declared with the `unsafe` modifier:  
  
```  
      unsafe static void FastCopy(byte[] src, byte[] dst, int count)  
{  
    // Unsafe context: can use pointers here.  
}  
```  
  
 The scope of the unsafe context extends from the parameter list to the end of the method, so pointers can also be used in the parameter list:  
  
```  
unsafe static void FastCopy ( byte* ps, byte* pd, int count ) {...}  
```  
  
 You can also use an unsafe block to enable the use of an unsafe code inside this block. For example:  
  
```  
      unsafe  
{  
    // Unsafe context: can use pointers here.  
}  
```  
  
 To compile unsafe code, you must specify the [/unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/unsafe-compiler-option.md) compiler option. Unsafe code is not verifiable by the common language runtime.
