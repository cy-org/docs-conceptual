# sealed (C# Reference)
When applied to a class, the `sealed` modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class `B` inherits from class `A`, but no class can inherit from class `B`.  
  
```  
class A {}      
sealed class B : A {}  
```  
  
 You can also use the `sealed` modifier on a method or property that overrides a virtual method or property in a base class. This enables you to allow classes to derive from your class and prevent them from overriding specific virtual methods or properties.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, `Z` inherits from `Y` but `Z` cannot override the virtual function `F` that is declared in `X` and sealed in `Y`.  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsModifiers#16](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/sealed_1.cs)]  
  
 When you define new methods or properties in a class, you can prevent deriving classes from overriding them by not declaring them as [virtual](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual.md).  
  
 It is an error to use the [abstract](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/abstract.md) modifier with a sealed class, because an abstract class must be inherited by a class that provides an implementation of the abstract methods or properties.  
  
 When applied to a method or property, the `sealed` modifier must always be used with [override](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/override.md).  
  
 Because structs are implicitly sealed, they cannot be inherited.  
  
 For more information, see [Inheritance](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance.md).  
  
 For more examples, see [Abstract and Sealed Classes and Class Members](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsModifiers#17](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/sealed_2.cs)]  
  
 In the previous example, you might try to inherit from the sealed class by using the following statement:  
  
 `class MyDerivedC: SealedClass {}   // Error`  
  
 The result is an error message:  
  
 `'MyDerivedC' cannot inherit from sealed class 'SealedClass'.`  
  
## C# Language Specification  
 [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](~/includes/csharplangspec-md.md)]  
  
## Remarks  
 To determine whether to seal a class, method, or property, you should generally consider the following two points:  
  
-   The potential benefits that deriving classes might gain through the ability to customize your class.  
  
-   The potential that deriving classes could modify your classes in such a way that they would no longer work correctly or as expected.
