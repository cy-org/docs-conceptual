# let clause (C# Reference)
In a query expression, it is sometimes useful to store the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses. You can do this with the `let` keyword, which creates a new range variable and initializes it with the result of the expression you supply. Once initialized with a value, the range variable cannot be used to store another value. However, if the range variable holds a queryable type, it can be queried.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example `let` is used in two ways:  
  
1.  To create an enumerable type that can itself be queried.  
  
2.  To enable the query to call `ToLower` only one time on the range variable `word`. Without using `let`, you would have to call `ToLower` in each predicate in the `where` clause.
