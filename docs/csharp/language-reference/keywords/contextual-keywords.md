# Contextual Keywords (C# Reference)
A contextual keyword is used to provide a specific meaning in the code, but it is not a reserved word in C#. The following contextual keywords are introduced in this section:  
  
|Keyword|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[add](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/add.md)|Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code subscribes to the event.|  
|[async](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md)|Indicates that the modified method, lambda expression, or anonymous method is asynchronous.|  
|[await](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/await.md)|Suspends an async method until an awaited task is completed.|  
|[dynamic](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/dynamic.md)|Defines a reference type that enables operations in which it occurs to bypass compile-time type checking.|  
|[get](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/get.md)|Defines an accessor method for a property or an indexer.|  
|[global](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/global.md)|Specifies the default global namespace, which is otherwise unnamed.|  
|[partial](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/partial-type.md)|Defines partial classes, structs, and interfaces throughout the same compilation unit.|  
|[remove](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/remove.md)|Defines a custom event accessor that is invoked when client code unsubscribes from the event.|  
|[set](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/set.md)|Defines an accessor method for a property or an indexer.|  
|[value](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/value.md)|Used to set accessors and to add or remove event handlers.|  
|[var](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/var.md)|Enables the type of a variable declared at method scope to be determined by the compiler.|  
|[when](when.md)|Specifies a filter condition for a `catch` block or the `case` label of a `switch` statement.|
|[where](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/where-generic-type-constraint.md)|Adds constraints to a generic declaration. (See also [where](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/where-clause.md)).|  
|[yield](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/yield.md)|Used in an iterator block to return a value to the enumerator object or to signal the end of iteration.|  
  
 All query keywords introduced in C# 3.0 are also contextual. For more information, see [Query Keywords (LINQ)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/query-keywords.md).
