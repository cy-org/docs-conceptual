# operator (C# Reference)
Use the `operator` keyword to overload a built-in operator or to provide a user-defined conversion in a class or struct declaration.  
  
## Example  
 The following is a very simplified class for fractional numbers. It overloads the + and * operators to perform fractional addition and multiplication, and also provides a conversion operator that converts a Fraction type to a double type.
