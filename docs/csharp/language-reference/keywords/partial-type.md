# partial (Type) (C# Reference)
Partial type definitions allow for the definition of a class, struct, or interface to be split into multiple files.  
  
 In File1.cs:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsContextual#3](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/partial-type_1.cs)]  
  
 In File2.cs the declaration:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsContextual#4](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/partial-type_2.cs)]  
  
## Remarks  
 Splitting a class, struct or interface type over several files can be useful when you are working with large projects, or with automatically generated code such as that provided by the [Windows Forms Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3c3d61f8-f36c-4d41-b9c3-398376fabb15). A partial type may contain a [partial method](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/partial-method.md). For more information, see [Partial Classes and Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md).
