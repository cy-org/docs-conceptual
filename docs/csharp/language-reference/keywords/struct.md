# struct (C# Reference)
A `struct` type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables, such as the coordinates of a rectangle or the characteristics of an item in an inventory. The following example shows a simple struct declaration:  
  
```  
public struct Book  
{  
    public decimal price;  
    public string title;  
    public string author;  
}  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 Structs can also contain [constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md), [constants](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.md), [fields](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields.md), [methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md), [properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), [indexers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/indexers/index.md), [operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/operators.md), [events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md), and [nested types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/nested-types.md), although if several such members are required, you should consider making your type a class instead.  
  
 For examples, see [Using Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-structs.md).  
  
 Structs can implement an interface but they cannot inherit from another struct. For that reason, struct members cannot be declared as `protected`.  
  
 For more information, see [Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/structs.md).
