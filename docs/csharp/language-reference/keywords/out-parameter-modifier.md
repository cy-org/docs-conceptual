# out parameter modifier (C# Reference)
The `out` keyword causes arguments to be passed by reference. It is like the [ref](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref.md) keyword, except that `ref` requires that the variable be initialized before it is passed. To use an `out` parameter, both the method definition and the calling method must explicitly use the `out` keyword. For example:  
  
 [!code-cs[cs-out-keyword](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out/out-1.cs)]  

> [!NOTE] 
> The `out` keyword can also be used with a generic type parameter to specify that the type parameter is covariant. For more information on the use of the `out` keyword in this context, see [out (Generic Modifier)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-generic-modifier.md).
  
 Variables passed as `out` arguments do not have to be initialized before being passed in a method call. However, the called method is required to assign a value before the method returns.  
  
 Although the `ref` and `out` keywords cause different run-time behavior, they are not considered part of the method signature at compile time. Therefore, methods cannot be overloaded if the only difference is that one method takes a `ref` argument and the other takes an `out` argument. The following code, for example, will not compile:  
  
```csharp
class CS0663_Example
{
    // Compiler error CS0663: "Cannot define overloaded 
    // methods that differ only on ref and out".
    public void SampleMethod(out int i) { }
    public void SampleMethod(ref int i) { }
}
```
  
Overloading is legal, however, if one method takes a `ref` or `out` argument and the other uses neither, like this:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out/out-3.cs)]  
  
 Properties are not variables and therefore cannot be passed as `out` parameters.  
  
 For information about passing arrays, see [Passing Arrays Using ref and out](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/passing-arrays-using-ref-and-out.md).  
  
 You can't use the `ref` and `out` keywords for the following kinds of methods:  
  
-   Async methods, which you define by using the [async](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) modifier.  
  
-   Iterator methods, which include a [yield return](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/yield.md) or `yield break` statement.  

## Declaring `out` arguments   

 Declaring a method with `out` arguments is useful when you want a method to return multiple values. The following example uses `out` to return three variables with a single method call. Note that the third argument is assigned to null. This enables methods to return values optionally.  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out/out-4.cs)]  

 The [Try pattern](/visualstudio/code-quality/ca1021-avoid-out-parameters#try-pattern-methods.md) involves returning a `bool` to indicate whether an operation succeeded and failed, and returning the value produced by the operation in an `out` argument. A number of parsing methods, such as the [DateTime.TryParse](xref:System.DateTime.TryParse(System.String,System.DateTime@)) method, use this pattern.
   
## Calling a method with an `out` argument

In C# 6 and earlier, you must declare a variable in a separate statement before you pass it as an `out` argument. The following example declares a variable named `number` before it is passed to the [Int32.TryParse](xref:System.Int32.TryParse(System.String,System.Int32@)) method, which attempts to convert a string to a number.

 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out/out-5.cs)]  

Starting with C# 7, you can declare the `out` variable in the argument list of the method call, rather than in a separate variable declaration. This produces more compact, readable code, and also prevents you from inadvertently assigning a value to the variable before the method call. The following example is like the previous example, except that it defines the `number` variable in the call to the [Int32.TryParse](xref:System.Int32.TryParse(System.String,System.Int32@)) method.

 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsMethodParams#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out/out-6.cs)]  
   
In the previous example, the `number` variable is strongly typed as an `int`. You can also declare an implicitly typed local variable, as the following example does.
