# protected (C# Reference)
The `protected` keyword is a member access modifier. A protected member is accessible within its class and by derived class instances. For a comparison of `protected` with the other access modifiers, see [Accessibility Levels](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/accessibility-levels.md).  
  
## Example  
 A protected member of a base class is accessible in a derived class only if the access occurs through the derived class type. For example, consider the following code segment:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsModifiers#11](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/protected_1.cs)]  
  
 The statement `a.x = 10` generates an error because it is made within the static method Main, and not an instance of class B.  
  
 Struct members cannot be protected because the struct cannot be inherited.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, the class `DerivedPoint` is derived from `Point`. Therefore, you can access the protected members of the base class directly from the derived class.  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsModifiers#12](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/protected_2.cs)]  
  
 If you change the access levels of `x` and `y` to [private](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/private.md), the compiler will issue the error messages:  
  
 `'Point.y' is inaccessible due to its protection level.`  
  
 `'Point.x' is inaccessible due to its protection level.`
