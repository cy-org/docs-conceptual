# true Operator (C# Reference)
Returns the [bool](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/bool.md) value `true` to indicate that an operand is true and returns `false` otherwise.  
  
 Prior to C# 2.0, the `true` and `false` operators were used to create user-defined nullable value types that were compatible with types such as `SqlBool`. However, the language now provides built-in support for nullable value types, and whenever possible you should use those instead of overloading the `true` and `false` operators. For more information, see [Nullable Types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/index.md).  
  
 With nullable Booleans, the expression `a != b` is not necessarily equal to `!(a == b)` because one or both of the values might be null. You need to overload both the `true` and `false` operators separately to correctly identify the null values in the expression. The following example shows how to overload and use the `true` and `false` operators.  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsOperator#16](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/true-operator_1.cs)]  
  
 A type that overloads the `true` and `false` operators can be used for the controlling expression in [if](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/if-else.md), [do](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/do.md), [while](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/while.md), and [for](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/for.md) statements and in [conditional expressions](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-operator.md).  
  
 If a type defines operator `true`, it must also define operator [false](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/false.md).  
  
 A type cannot directly overload the conditional logical operators ([&&](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-and-operator.md) and [&#124;&#124;](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-or-operator.md)), but an equivalent effect can be achieved by overloading the regular logical operators and operators `true` and `false`.
