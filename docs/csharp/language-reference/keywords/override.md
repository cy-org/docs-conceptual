# override (C# Reference)
The `override` modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property, indexer, or event.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, the `Square` class must provide an overridden implementation of `Area` because `Area` is inherited from the abstract `ShapesClass`:  
  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsModifiers#1](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/override_1.cs)]  
  
 An `override` method provides a new implementation of a member that is inherited from a base class. The method that is overridden by an `override` declaration is known as the overridden base method. The overridden base method must have the same signature as the `override` method. For information about inheritance, see [Inheritance](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance.md).  
  
 You cannot override a non-virtual or static method. The overridden base method must be `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override`.  
  
 An `override` declaration cannot change the accessibility of the `virtual` method. Both the `override` method and the `virtual` method must have the same [access level modifier](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/access-modifiers.md).  
  
 You cannot use the `new`, `static`, or `virtual` modifiers to modify an `override` method.  
  
 An overriding property declaration must specify exactly the same access modifier, type, and name as the inherited property, and the overridden property must be `virtual`, `abstract`, or `override`.  
  
 For more information about how to use the `override` keyword, see [Versioning with the Override and New Keywords](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/versioning-with-the-override-and-new-keywords.md) and [Knowing when to use Override and New Keywords](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/knowing-when-to-use-override-and-new-keywords.md).  
  
## Example  
 This example defines a base class named `Employee`, and a derived class named `SalesEmployee`. The `SalesEmployee` class includes an extra property, `salesbonus`, and overrides the method `CalculatePay` in order to take it into account.
