# throw (C# Reference)
Signals the occurrence of an exception during program execution.  
  
## Remarks

The syntax of `throw` is:

```csharp
throw [e]
```
where `e` is an instance of a class derived from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>. The following example uses the `throw` statement to throw an @System.IndexOutOfRangeException if the argument passed to a method named `GetNumber` does not correspond to a valid index of an internal array.

[!code-cs[csrefKeyword#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw/throw-1.cs#1)]  

Method callers then use a `try-catch` or `try-catch-finally` block to handle the thrown exception. The following example handles the exception thrown by the `GetNumber` method.

[!code-cs[csrefKeyword#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw/throw-1.cs#2)]  

## Re-throwing an exception

`throw` can also be used in a `catch` block to re-throw an exception handled in a `catch` block.  In this case, `throw` does not take an exception operand. It is most useful when a method passes on an argument from a caller to some other library method, and the library method throws an exception that must be passed on to the caller. For example, the following example re-throws an @System.NullReferenceException that is thrown when attempting to retrieve the first character of an uninitialized string. 

[!code-cs[csrefKeyword#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw/throw-3.cs#3)]  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can also use the `throw e` syntax in a `catch` block to instantiate a new exception that you pass on to the caller. In this case, the stack trace of the original exception, which is available from the @System.Exception.Stacktrace property, is not preserved.
 
## The `throw` expression

Starting with C# 7, `throw` can be used as an expression as well as a statement. This allows an exception to be thrown in contexts that were previously unsupported. These include:

- [the conditional operator](../operators/conditional-operator.md). The following example uses a `throw` expression to throw an @System.ArgumentException if a method is passed an empty string array. Before C# 7, this logic would need to appear in an `if`/`else` statement.

   [!code-cs[csrefKeyword#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw/conditional.cs#1)]  
  
- [the null-coalescing operator](../operators/null-conditional-operator.md). In the following example, a `throw` expression is used with a null-coalescing operator to throw an exception if the string assigned to a `Name` property is `null`.
 
   [!code-cs[csrefKeyword#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw/coalescing.cs#1)]  
 
- an expression-bodied [lambda](../../lambda-expressions.md) or method. The following example illustrates an expression-bodied method that throws an @System.InvalidCastException because a conversion to a @System.DateTime value is not supported.
 
   [!code-cs[csrefKeyword#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw/exp-bodied.cs#1)]
