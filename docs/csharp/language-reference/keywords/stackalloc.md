# stackalloc (C# Reference)
The `stackalloc` keyword is used in an unsafe code context to allocate a block of memory on the stack.  
  
```  
int* block = stackalloc int[100];  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The keyword is valid only in local variable initializers. The following code causes compiler errors.  
  
```  
int* block;  
// The following assignment statement causes compiler errors. You  
// can use stackalloc only when declaring and initializing a local   
// variable.  
block = stackalloc int[100];  
```  
  
 Because pointer types are involved, `stackalloc` requires [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) context. For more information, see [Unsafe Code and Pointers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/index.md).  
  
 `stackalloc` is like [_alloca](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/alloca) in the C run-time library.  
  
 The following example calculates and displays the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. In the code, a block of memory of sufficient size to contain 20 elements of type `int` is allocated on the stack, not the heap. The address of the block is stored in the pointer `fib`. This memory is not subject to garbage collection and therefore does not have to be pinned (by using [fixed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/fixed-statement.md)). The lifetime of the memory block is limited to the lifetime of the method that defines it. You cannot free the memory before the method returns.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsOperator#15](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/stackalloc_1.cs)]  
  
## Security  
 Unsafe code is less secure than safe alternatives. However, the use of `stackalloc` automatically enables buffer overrun detection features in the common language runtime (CLR). If a buffer overrun is detected, the process is terminated as quickly as possible to minimize the chance that malicious code is executed.
