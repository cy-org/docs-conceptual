# float (C# Reference)
The `float` keyword signifies a simple type that stores 32-bit floating-point values. The following table shows the precision and approximate range for the `float` type.  
  
|Type|Approximate range|Precision|.NET Framework type|  
|----------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------|  
|`float`|-3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup>to +3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup>|7 digits|<xref:System.Single?displayProperty=fullName>|  
  
## Literals  
 By default, a real numeric literal on the right side of the assignment operator is treated as [double](double.md). Therefore, to initialize a float variable, use the suffix `f` or `F`, as in the following example:  
  
```csharp
float x = 3.5F;  
```
  
 If you do not use the suffix in the previous declaration, you will get a compilation error because you are trying to store a [double](double.md) value into a `float` variable.  
  
## Conversions  
 You can mix numeric integral types and floating-point types in an expression. In this case, the integral types are converted to floating-point types. The evaluation of the expression is performed according to the following rules:  
  
-   If one of the floating-point types is [double](double.md), the expression evaluates to [double](double.md) or [bool](bool.md) in relational or Boolean expressions.  
  
-   If there is no [double](double.md) type in the expression, the expression evaluates to `float` or [bool](bool.md) in relational or Boolean expressions.  
  
 A floating-point expression can contain the following sets of values:  
  
-   Positive and negative zero  
  
-   Positive and negative infinity  
  
-   Not-a-Number value (NaN)  
  
-   The finite set of nonzero values  
  
 For more information about these values, see IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, available on the [IEEE](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=26269) Web site.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, an [int](int.md), a [short](short.md), and a `float` are included in a mathematical expression giving a `float` result. (Remember that `float` is an alias for the <xref:System.Single?displayProperty=fullName> type.) Notice that there is no [double](double.md) in the expression.
