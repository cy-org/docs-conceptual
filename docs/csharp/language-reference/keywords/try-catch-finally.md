# try-catch-finally (C# Reference)
A common usage of `catch` and `finally` together is to obtain and use resources in a `try` block, deal with exceptional circumstances in a `catch` block, and release the resources in the `finally` block.  
  
 For more information and examples on re-throwing exceptions, see [try-catch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md) and [Throwing Exceptions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/xhcbs8fz). For more information about the `finally` block, see [try-finally](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-finally.md).
