# const (C# Reference)
You use the `const` keyword to declare a constant field or a constant local. Constant fields and locals aren't variables and may not be modified. Constants can be numbers, Boolean values, strings, or a null reference. Don’t create a constant to represent information that you expect to change at any time. For example, don’t use a constant field to store the price of a service, a product version number, or the brand name of a company. These values can change over time, and because compilers propagate constants, other code compiled with your libraries will have to be recompiled to see the changes. See also the [readonly](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly.md) keyword. For example:  
  
```csharp
const int x = 0;  
public const double gravitationalConstant = 6.673e-11;  
private const string productName = "Visual C#";  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The type of a constant declaration specifies the type of the members that the declaration introduces. The initializer of a constant local or a constant field must be a constant expression that can be implicitly converted to the target type.  
  
 A constant expression is an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile time. Therefore, the only possible values for constants of reference types are `string` and a null reference.  
  
 The constant declaration can declare multiple constants, such as:  
  
```csharp
public const double x = 1.0, y = 2.0, z = 3.0;  
```  
  
 The `static` modifier is not allowed in a constant declaration.  
  
 A constant can participate in a constant expression, as follows:  
  
```csharp
public const int c1 = 5;  
public const int c2 = c1 + 100;  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The [readonly](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly.md) keyword differs from the `const` keyword. A `const` field can only be initialized at the declaration of the field. A `readonly` field can be initialized either at the declaration or in a constructor. Therefore, `readonly` fields can have different values depending on the constructor used. Also, although a `const` field is a compile-time constant, the `readonly` field can be used for run-time constants, as in this line: `public static readonly uint l1 = (uint)DateTime.Now.Ticks;`
