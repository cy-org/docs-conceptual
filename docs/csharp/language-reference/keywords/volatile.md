# volatile (C# Reference)
The `volatile` keyword indicates that a field might be modified by multiple threads that are executing at the same time. Fields that are declared `volatile` are not subject to compiler optimizations that assume access by a single thread. This ensures that the most up-to-date value is present in the field at all times.  
  
 The `volatile` modifier is usually used for a field that is accessed by multiple threads without using the [lock](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/lock-statement.md) statement to serialize access.  
  
 The `volatile` keyword can be applied to fields of these types:  
  
-   Reference types.  
  
-   Pointer types (in an unsafe context). Note that although the pointer itself can be volatile, the object that it points to cannot. In other words, you cannot declare a "pointer to volatile."  
  
-   Types such as sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, char, float, and bool.  
  
-   An enum type with one of the following base types: byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, or uint.  
  
-   Generic type parameters known to be reference types.  
  
-   <xref:System.IntPtr> and <xref:System.UIntPtr>.  
  
 The volatile keyword can only be applied to fields of a class or struct. Local variables cannot be declared `volatile`.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to declare a public field variable as `volatile`.

## Example  
 The following example demonstrates how an auxiliary or worker thread can be created and used to perform processing in parallel with that of the primary thread.
