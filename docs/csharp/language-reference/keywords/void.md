# void (C# Reference)
When used as the return type for a method, `void` specifies that the method doesn't return a value.

`void` isn't allowed in the parameter list of a method. A method that takes no parameters and returns no value is declared as follows:

```csharp
public void SampleMethod()
{
    // Body of the method.
}
```

`void` is also used in an unsafe context to declare a pointer to an unknown type. For more information, see [Pointer types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/pointer-types.md).

`void` is an alias for the .NET Framework <xref:System.Void?displayProperty=fullName> type.
