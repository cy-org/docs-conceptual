# var (C# Reference)
Beginning in Visual C# 3.0, variables that are declared at method scope can have an implicit "type" `var`. An implicitly typed local variable is strongly typed just as if you had declared the type yourself, but the compiler determines the type. The following two declarations of `i` are functionally equivalent:  
  
```  
var i = 10; // implicitly typed  
int i = 10; //explicitly typed  
```  
  
 For more information, see [Implicitly Typed Local Variables](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/implicitly-typed-local-variables.md) and [Type Relationships in LINQ Query Operations](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-linq-query-operations.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows two query expressions. In the first expression, the use of `var` is permitted but is not required, because the type of the query result can be stated explicitly as an `IEnumerable<string>`. However, in the second expression, `var` must be used because the result is a collection of anonymous types, and the name of that type is not accessible except to the compiler itself. Note that in Example #2, the `foreach` iteration variable `item` must also be implicitly typed.
