# base (C# Reference)

The `base` keyword is used to access members of the base class from within a derived class:

- Call a method on the base class that has been overridden by another method.

- Specify which base-class constructor should be called when creating instances of the derived class.

A base class access is permitted only in a constructor, an instance method, or an instance property accessor.

It is an error to use the `base` keyword from within a static method.

The base class that is accessed is the base class specified in the class declaration. For example, if you specify `class ClassB : ClassA`, the members of ClassA are accessed from ClassB, regardless of the base class of ClassA.

## Example
In this example, both the base class, `Person`, and the derived class, `Employee`, have a method named `Getinfo`. By using the `base` keyword, it is possible to call the `Getinfo` method on the base class, from within the derived class.

For additional examples, see [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md), [virtual](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/virtual.md), and [override](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/override.md).

## Example
This example shows how to specify the base-class constructor called when creating instances of a derived class.
