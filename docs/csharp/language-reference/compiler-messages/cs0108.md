# Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108
'member1' hides inherited member 'member2'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.  
  
 A variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class. However, the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword was not used. This warning informs you that you should use **new**; the variable is declared as if **new** had been used in the declaration.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0108:  
  
```csharp  
// CS0108.cs  
// compile with: /W:2  
using System;  
  
namespace x  
{  
   public class clx  
   {  
      public int i = 1;  
   }  
  
   public class cly : clx  
   {  
      public static int i = 2;   // CS0108, use the new keyword  
      // Use the following line instead:  
      // public static new int i = 2;  
  
      public static void Main()  
      {  
         Console.WriteLine(i);  
      }  
   }  
}  
```
