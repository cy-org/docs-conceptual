# Compiler Error CS2032
Character 'character' is not allowed on the command-line or in response files  
  
 Response files and the command line options for csc.exe cannot contain ASCII control characters in the range 0-31 or the pipe (`|`) character.  
  
 Compiler error CS2032 is difficult to demonstrate from the command line because the command line processor and the integrated development environment (IDE) filter out characters that are not valid. The following procedure generates the error by using a [response file](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md).  
  
### To generate this error  
  
1.  In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:  
  
    ```csharp  
    /target:exe /out:cs|2032.exe cs2032.cs  
    ```  
  
2.  In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want.  
  
3.  Open the **Start** menu. Locate and select the [Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio](../../../framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md).
  
4.  Change the current directory to `C:\Users\\<YourUsername>\Documents`.  
  
5.  Run the following command from the command prompt: `csc @cs2032.rsp`  
  
6.  The CS2032 error message appears because the response file, CS2032.rsp, contains a pipe character.
