# Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690
Accessing a member on 'member' may cause a runtime exception because it is a field of a marshal-by-reference class  
  
 This warning occurs when you try to call a method, property, or indexer on a member of a class that derives from <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>, and the member is a value type. Objects that inherit from `MarshalByRefObject` are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain. If any code ever attempts to directly access the value-type member of such an object across an application domain, a runtime exception will occur. To resolve the warning, first copy the member into a local variable and call the method on that variable.  
  
 The following sample generates CS1690:  
  
```csharp  
// CS1690.cs  
using System;  
  
class WarningCS1690: MarshalByRefObject  
{  
   int i = 5;  
  
   public static void Main()   
   {  
     WarningCS1690 e = new WarningCS1690();  
     e.i.ToString();   // CS1690  
  
     // OK  
     int i = e.i;  
     i.ToString();  
     e.i = i;  
   }  
}  
```
