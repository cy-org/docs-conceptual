# #if (C# Reference)
When the C# compiler encounters an `#if` directive, followed eventually by an [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md) directive, it will compile the code between the directives only if the specified symbol is defined.  Unlike C and C++, you cannot assign a numeric value to a symbol; the #if statement in C# is Boolean and only tests whether the symbol has been defined or not. For example,  
  
```csharp
#define DEBUG  
// ...  
#if DEBUG  
    Console.WriteLine("Debug version");  
#endif  
```  
  
 You can use the operators [==](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-comparison-operator.md) (equality), [!=](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/not-equal-operator.md) (inequality) only to test for [true](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/true.md) or [false](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/false.md) . True means the symbol is defined. The statement `#if DEBUG` has the same meaning as `#if (DEBUG == true)`. You can use the operators [&&](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-and-operator.md) (and), [&#124;&#124;](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-or-operator.md) (or), and [!](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/logical-negation-operator.md) (not) to evaluate whether multiple symbols have been defined. You can also group symbols and operators with parentheses.  
  
## Remarks  
 `#if`, along with the [#else](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md), [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md), [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md), [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md), and [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md) directives, lets you include or exclude code based on the existence of one or more symbols. This can be useful when compiling code for a debug build or when compiling for a specific configuration.  
  
 A conditional directive beginning with a `#if` directive must explicitly be terminated with a `#endif` directive.  
  
 `#define` lets you define a symbol, such that, by using the symbol as the expression passed to the `#if` directive, the expression will evaluate to `true`.  
  
 You can also define a symbol with the [/define](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/define-compiler-option.md) compiler option. You can undefine a symbol with [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md).  
  
 A symbol that you define with `/define` or with `#define` does not conflict with a variable of the same name. That is, a variable name should not be passed to a preprocessor directive and a symbol can only be evaluated by a preprocessor directive.  
  
 The scope of a symbol created with `#define` is the file in which it was defined.  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp
// preprocessor_if.cs  
#define DEBUG#define MYTEST  
using System;  
public class MyClass   
{  
    static void Main()   
    {  
#if (DEBUG && !MYTEST)  
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG is defined");  
#elif (!DEBUG && MYTEST)  
        Console.WriteLine("MYTEST is defined");  
#elif (DEBUG && MYTEST)  
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG and MYTEST are defined");  
#else  
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG and MYTEST are not defined");  
#endif  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 **DEBUG and MYTEST are defined**
