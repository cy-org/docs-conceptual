# C# preprocessor directives
This section contains information about the following C# preprocessor directives:

- [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md)
- [#else](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md)
- [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md)
- [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md)
- [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md)
- [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md)
- [#warning](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-warning.md)
- [#error](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-error.md)
- [#line](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-line.md)
- [#region](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-region.md)
- [#endregion](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endregion.md)
- [#pragma](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-pragma.md)
- [#pragma warning](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-pragma-warning.md)
- [#pragma checksum](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-pragma-checksum.md)

See the individual topics for more information and examples.

Although the compiler doesn't have a separate preprocessor, the directives described in this section are processed as if there were one. They are used to help in conditional compilation. Unlike C and C++ directives, you cannot use these directives to create macros.

A preprocessor directive must be the only instruction on a line.
