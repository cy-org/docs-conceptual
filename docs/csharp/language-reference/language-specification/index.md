# C# 6.0 draft Language Specification
The C# Language Specification is the definitive source for C# syntax and usage. This specification contains detailed information about all aspects of the language, including many points that the documentation for Visual C# doesn't cover.

You can download version 5.0 of this specification from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=7029). If you've installed Visual Studio 2015, you can also find the specification on your computer in the Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC#/Specifications/1033 folder. If you have another version of Visual Studio installed or if you installed Visual Studio in a language other than English, change the path as appropriate.

Version 6.0 of the specification has not been approved as a standard. This site contains the [*draft* C# 6.0 specification](../../../../_csharplang/spec/lexical-structure.md). It is built from the markdown files contained in [the dotnet/csharplang GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/README.md).

Issues on the draft specification should be created in the [dotnet/csharplang](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues) repository. Or, if you are interested
in fixing any errors you find, you may submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/pulls) to the same repository.
