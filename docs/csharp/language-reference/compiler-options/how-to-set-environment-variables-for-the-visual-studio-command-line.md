# How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line
The vsvars32.bat file sets the appropriate environment variables to enable command-line builds. For more information about vsvars32.bat, see [Knowledge Base article Q248802](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225042).  
  
 If the current version of Visual Studio is installed on a computer that also has an earlier version of Visual Studio, you should not run vsvars32.bat or vcvars32.bat from different versions in the same Command Prompt window.  
  
### To run VSVARS32.BAT  
  
1.  From the **Start** menu, open the **Developer Command Prompt for VS2012**.  
  
2.  Change to the Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio *Version*\Common7\Tools or Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio *Version*\Common7\Tools subdirectory of your installation.  
  
3.  Run VSVARS32.bat by typing **VSVARS32**.  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    >  VSVARS32.bat can vary from computer to computer. Do not replace a missing or damaged VSVARS32.bat file with a VSVARS32.bat from another computer. Instead, rerun setup to replace the missing file.
