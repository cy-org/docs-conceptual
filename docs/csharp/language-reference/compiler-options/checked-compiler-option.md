# /checked (C# Compiler Options)
The **/checked** option specifies whether an integer arithmetic statement that results in a value that is outside the range of the data type, and that is not in the scope of a [checked](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked.md) or [unchecked](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unchecked.md) keyword, causes a run-time exception.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```console  
/checked[+ | -]  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 An integer arithmetic statement that is in the scope of a `checked` or `unchecked` keyword is not subject to the effect of the **/checked** option.  
  
 If an integer arithmetic statement that is not in the scope of a `checked` or `unchecked` keyword results in a value outside the range of the data type, and **/checked+** (**/checked**) is used in the compilation, that statement causes an exception at run time. If **/checked-** is used in the compilation, that statement does not cause an exception at run time.  
  
 The default value for this option is **/checked-**. One scenario for using **/checked-** is in building large applications. Sometimes automated tools are used to build such applications, and such a tool might automatically set **/checked** to +. You can override the tool's global default by specifying **/checked-**.  
  
### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  
  
1.  Open the project's **Properties** page. For more information, see [Build Page, Project Designer (C#)](/visualstudio/ide/reference/build-page-project-designer-csharp).  
  
2.  Click the **Build** property page.  
  
3.  Click the **Advanced** button.  
  
4.  Modify the **Check for arithmetic overflow/underflow** property.  
  
 To access this compiler option programmatically, see <xref:VSLangProj80.CSharpProjectConfigurationProperties3.CheckForOverflowUnderflow%2A>.  
  
## Example  
 The following command compiles `t2.cs`. The use of `/checked` in the command specifies that any integer arithmetic statement in the file that is not in the scope of a `checked` or `unchecked` keyword, and that results in a value that is outside the range of the data type, causes an exception at run time.  
  
```console  
csc t2.cs /checked  
```
