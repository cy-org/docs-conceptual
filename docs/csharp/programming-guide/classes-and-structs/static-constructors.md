# Static Constructors (C# Programming Guide)
A static constructor is used to initialize any [static](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/static.md) data, or to perform a particular action that needs to be performed once only. It is called automatically before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#14](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/static-constructors_1.cs)]  
  
 Static constructors have the following properties:  
  
-   A static constructor does not take access modifiers or have parameters.  
  
-   A static constructor is called automatically to initialize the [class](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md) before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.  
  
-   A static constructor cannot be called directly.  
  
-   The user has no control on when the static constructor is executed in the program.  
  
-   A typical use of static constructors is when the class is using a log file and the constructor is used to write entries to this file.  
  
-   Static constructors are also useful when creating wrapper classes for unmanaged code, when the constructor can call the `LoadLibrary` method.  
  
-   If a static constructor throws an exception, the runtime will not invoke it a second time, and the type will remain uninitialized for the lifetime of the application domain in which your program is running.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, class `Bus` has a static constructor. When the first instance of `Bus` is created (`bus1`), the static constructor is invoked to initialize the class. The sample output verifies that the static constructor runs only one time, even though two instances of `Bus` are created, and that it runs before the instance constructor runs.
