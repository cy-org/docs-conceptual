# How to: Implement a Lightweight Class with Auto-Implemented Properties (C# Programming Guide)
This example shows how to create an immutable lightweight class that serves only to encapsulate a set of auto-implemented properties. Use this kind of construct instead of a struct when you must use reference type semantics.  
  
 You can make an immutable property in two ways.  You can declare the [set](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/set.md) accessor.to be [private](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/private.md).  The property is only settable within the type, but it is immutable to consumers.  You can instead declare only the [get](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/get.md) accessor, which makes the property immutable everywhere except in the typeâ€™s constructor.  
  
 When you declare a private `set` accessor, you cannot use an object initializer to initialize the property. You must use a constructor or a factory method.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows two ways to implement an immutable class that has auto-implemented properties. Each way declares one of the properties with a private `set` and one of the properties with a `get` only.  The first class uses a constructor only to initialize the properties, and the second class uses a static factory method that calls a constructor.  
  
```csharp  
// This class is immutable. After an object is created,   
    // it cannot be modified from outside the class. It uses a   
    // constructor to initialize its properties.   
    class Contact  
    {  
        // Read-only properties.   
        public string Name { get; }  
        public string Address { get; private set; }  
  
        // Public constructor.   
        public Contact(string contactName, string contactAddress)  
        {  
            Name = contactName;  
            Address = contactAddress;                 
        }  
    }  
  
    // This class is immutable. After an object is created,   
    // it cannot be modified from outside the class. It uses a   
    // static method and private constructor to initialize its properties.      
    public class Contact2  
    {  
        // Read-only properties.   
        public string Name { get; private set; }  
        public string Address { get; }  
  
        // Private constructor.   
        private Contact2(string contactName, string contactAddress)  
        {  
            Name = contactName;  
            Address = contactAddress;                 
        }  
  
        // Public factory method.   
        public static Contact2 CreateContact(string name, string address)  
        {  
            return new Contact2(name, address);  
        }  
    }  
  
    public class Program  
    {   
        static void Main()  
        {  
            // Some simple data sources.   
            string[] names = {"Terry Adams","Fadi Fakhouri", "Hanying Feng",   
                              "Cesar Garcia", "Debra Garcia"};  
            string[] addresses = {"123 Main St.", "345 Cypress Ave.", "678 1st Ave",  
                                  "12 108th St.", "89 E. 42nd St."};  
  
            // Simple query to demonstrate object creation in select clause.   
            // Create Contact objects by using a constructor.   
            var query1 = from i in Enumerable.Range(0, 5)  
                        select new Contact(names[i], addresses[i]);  
  
            // List elements cannot be modified by client code.   
            var list = query1.ToList();  
            foreach (var contact in list)  
            {  
                Console.WriteLine("{0}, {1}", contact.Name, contact.Address);  
            }  
  
            // Create Contact2 objects by using a static factory method.   
            var query2 = from i in Enumerable.Range(0, 5)  
                         select Contact2.CreateContact(names[i], addresses[i]);  
  
            // Console output is identical to query1.   
            var list2 = query2.ToList();  
  
            // List elements cannot be modified by client code.   
            // CS0272:   
            // list2[0].Name = "Eugene Zabokritski";   
  
            // Keep the console open in debug mode.  
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");  
            Console.ReadKey();                  
        }  
    }  
  
/* Output:  
    Terry Adams, 123 Main St.  
    Fadi Fakhouri, 345 Cypress Ave.

```  
  
 The compiler creates backing fields for each auto-implemented property. The fields are not accessible directly from source code.
