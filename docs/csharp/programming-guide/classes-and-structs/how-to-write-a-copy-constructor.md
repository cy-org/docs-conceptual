# How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)
C# doesn't provide a copy constructor for objects, but you can write one yourself.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, the `Person`[class](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md) defines a copy constructor that takes, as its argument, an instance of `Person`. The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of `Person`. The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the `Name` and `Age` properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class.
