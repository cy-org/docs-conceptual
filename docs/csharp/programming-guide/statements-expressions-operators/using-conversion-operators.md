# Using Conversion Operators (C# Programming Guide)
You can use `implicit` conversion operators, which are easier to use, or `explicit` conversion operators, which clearly indicate to anyone reading the code that you're converting a type. This topic demonstrates both types of conversion operator.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For information about simple type conversions, see [How to: Convert a String to a Number](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-convert-a-string-to-a-number.md), [How to: Convert a byte Array to an int](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-convert-a-byte-array-to-an-int.md), [How to: Convert Between Hexadecimal Strings and Numeric Types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/how-to-convert-between-hexadecimal-strings-and-numeric-types.md), or <xref:System.Convert>.  
  
## Example  
 This is an example of an explicit conversion operator. This operator converts from the type <xref:System.Byte> to a value type called `Digit`. Because not all bytes can be converted to a digit, the conversion is explicit, meaning that a cast must be used, as shown in the `Main` method.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideStatements#11](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/using-conversion-operators_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 This example demonstrates an implicit conversion operator by defining a conversion operator that undoes what the previous example did: it converts from a value class called `Digit` to the integral <xref:System.Byte> type. Because any digit can be converted to a <xref:System.Byte>, there's no need to force users to be explicit about the conversion.
