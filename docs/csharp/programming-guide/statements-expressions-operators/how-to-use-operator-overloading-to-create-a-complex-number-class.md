# How to: Use Operator Overloading to Create a Complex Number Class (C# Programming Guide)
This example shows how you can use operator overloading to create a complex number class `Complex` that defines complex addition. The program displays the imaginary and the real parts of the numbers and the addition result using an override of the `ToString` method.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideStatements#16](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-operator-overloading-to-create-a-complex-number-class_1.cs)]
