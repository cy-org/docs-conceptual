# How to: Use the My Namespace (C# Programming Guide)
The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices> namespace (`My` in Visual Basic) provides easy and intuitive access to a number of .NET Framework classes, enabling you to write code that interacts with the computer, application, settings, resources, and so on. Although originally designed for use with Visual Basic, the `MyServices` namespace can be used in C# applications.  
  
 For more information about using the `MyServices` namespace from Visual Basic, see [Development with My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/index.md).  
  
## Adding a Reference  
 Before you can use the `MyServices` classes in your solution, you must add a reference to the Visual Basic library.  
  
#### To add a reference to the Visual Basic library  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **References** node, and select **Add Reference**.  
  
2.  When the **References** dialog box appears, scroll down the list, and select Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll.  
  
     You might also want to include the following line in the `using` section at the start of your program.  
  
     [!code-cs[csProgGuideNamespaces#18](../../../csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-the-my-namespace_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 This example calls various static methods contained in the `MyServices` namespace. For this code to compile, a reference to Microsoft.VisualBasic.DLL must be added to the project.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideNamespaces#19](../../../csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-the-my-namespace_2.cs)]  
  
 Not all the classes in the `MyServices` namespace can be called from a C# application: for example, the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.FileSystemProxy> class is not compatible. In this particular case, the static methods that are part of <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem>, which are also contained in VisualBasic.dll, can be used instead. For example, here is how to use one such method to duplicate a directory:
