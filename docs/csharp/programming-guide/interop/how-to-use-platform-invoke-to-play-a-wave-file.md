# How to: Use Platform Invoke to Play a Wave File (C# Programming Guide)
The following C# code example illustrates how to use platform invoke services to play a wave sound file on the Windows operating system.  
  
## Example  
 This example code uses `DllImport` to import `winmm.dll`'s `PlaySound` method entry point as `Form1 PlaySound()`. The example has a simple Windows Form with a button. Clicking the button opens a standard windows <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> dialog box so that you can open a file to play. When a wave file is selected, it is played by using the `PlaySound()` method of the winmm.DLL assembly method. For more information about winmm.dll's `PlaySound` method, see [Using the PlaySound function with Waveform-Audio Files](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148553). Browse and select a file that has a .wav extension, and then click **Open** to play the wave file by using platform invoke. A text box shows the full path of the file selected.  
  
 The **Open Files** dialog box is filtered to show only files that have a .wav extension through the filter settings:

## Compiling the Code  
  
### To compile the code  
  
1.  Create a new C# Windows Application project in Visual Studio and name it **WinSound**.  
  
2.  Copy the code above, and paste it over the contents of the `Form1.cs` file.  
  
3.  Copy the following code, and paste it in the `Form1.Designer.cs` file, in the `InitializeComponent()` method, after any existing code.

4.  Compile and run the code.
