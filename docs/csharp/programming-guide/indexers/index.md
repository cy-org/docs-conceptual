# Indexers (C# Programming Guide)

Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explicitly specifying a type or instance member. Indexers resemble [properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md) except that their accessors take parameters.  
 
 The following example defines a generic class with simple [get](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/get.md) and [set](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/set.md) accessor methods to assign and retrieve values. The `Program` class creates an instance of this class for storing strings.

## Expression Body Definitions  
 
It is common for an indexer's get or set accessor to consist of a single statement that either returns or sets a value. Expression-bodied members provide a simplified syntax to support this scenario. Starting with C# 6, a read-only indexer can be implemented as an expression-bodied member, as the following example shows.

[!code-cs[indexers#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/indexer-2.cs)]  

Note that `=>` introduces the expression body, and that the `get` keyword is not used. 

Starting with C# 7, both the get and set accessor can be an implemented as expression-bodied members. In this case, both `get` and `set` keywords must be used. For example:

[!code-cs[indexers#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/indexers/indexer-3.cs)]  
  
## Indexers Overview  
  
-   Indexers enable objects to be indexed in a similar manner to arrays.  
  
-   A `get` accessor returns a value. A `set` accessor assigns a value.  
  
-   The [this](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/this.md) keyword is used to define the indexer.  
  
-   The [value](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/value.md) keyword is used to define the value being assigned by the `set` indexer.  
  
-   Indexers do not have to be indexed by an integer value; it is up to you how to define the specific look-up mechanism.  
  
-   Indexers can be overloaded.  
  
-   Indexers can have more than one formal parameter, for example, when accessing a two-dimensional array.
