# How to: Create Unsigned Friend Assemblies (C#)
This example shows how to use friend assemblies with assemblies that are unsigned.  
  
### To create an assembly and a friend assembly  
  
1.  Open a command prompt.  
  
2.  Create a C# file named `friend_signed_A.` that contains the following code. The code uses the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute to declare friend_signed_B as a friend assembly.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // friend_unsigned_A.cs  
    // Compile with:   
    // csc /target:library friend_unsigned_A.cs  
    using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;  
    using System;  
  
    [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("friend_unsigned_B")]  
  
    // Type is internal by default.  
    class Class1  
    {  
        public void Test()  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("Class1.Test");  
        }  
    }  
  
    // Public type with internal member.  
    public class Class2  
    {  
        internal void Test()  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("Class2.Test");  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
3.  Compile and sign friend_signed_A by using the following command.  
  
    ```csharp  
    csc /target:library friend_unsigned_A.cs  
    ```  
  
4.  Create a C# file named `friend_unsigned_B` that contains the following code. Because friend_unsigned_A specifies friend_unsigned_B as a friend assembly, the code in friend_unsigned_B can access `internal` types and members from friend_unsigned_A.  
  
    ```csharp  
    // friend_unsigned_B.cs  
    // Compile with:   
    // csc /r:friend_unsigned_A.dll /out:friend_unsigned_B.exe friend_unsigned_B.cs  
    public class Program  
    {  
        static void Main()  
        {  
            // Access an internal type.  
            Class1 inst1 = new Class1();  
            inst1.Test();  
  
            Class2 inst2 = new Class2();  
            // Access an internal member of a public type.  
            inst2.Test();  
  
            System.Console.ReadLine();  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
5.  Compile friend_signed_B by using the following command.  
  
    ```csharp  
    csc /r:friend_unsigned_A.dll /out:friend_unsigned_B.exe friend_unsigned_B.cs  
    ```  
  
     The name of the assembly that is generated by the compiler must match the friend assembly name that is passed to the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute. You must explicitly specify the name of the output assembly (.exe or .dll) by using the `/out` compiler option. For more information, see [/out (C# Compiler Options)](../../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/out-compiler-option.md).  
  
6.  Run the friend_signed_B.exe file.  
  
     The program prints two strings: "Class1.Test" and "Class2.Test".  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 There are similarities between the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute and the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission> class. The main difference is that <xref:System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission> can demand security permissions to run a particular section of code, whereas the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute controls the visibility of `internal` types and members.
