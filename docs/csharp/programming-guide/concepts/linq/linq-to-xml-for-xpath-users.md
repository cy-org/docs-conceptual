# LINQ to XML for XPath Users (C#)
This set of topics show a number of XPath expressions and their [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] equivalents.  
  
 All of the examples use the XPath functionality in [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] that is made available by the extension methods in <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=fullName>. The examples execute both the XPath expression and the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] expression. Each example then compares the results of both queries, validating that the XPath expression is functionally equivalent to the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] query. As both types of queries return nodes from the same XML tree, the query result comparison is made using referential identity.
