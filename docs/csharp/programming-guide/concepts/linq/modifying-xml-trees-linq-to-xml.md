# Modifying XML Trees (LINQ to XML) (C#)
[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] is an in-memory store for an XML tree. After you load or parse an XML tree from a source, [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] lets you modify that tree in place, and then serialize the tree, perhaps saving it to a file or sending it to a remote server.  
  
 When you modify a tree in place, you use certain methods, such as <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.Add%2A>.  
  
 However, there is another approach, which is to use functional construction to generate a new tree with a different shape. Depending on the types of changes that you need to make to your XML tree, and depending on the size of the tree, this approach can be more robust and easier to develop. The first topic in this section compares these two approaches.
