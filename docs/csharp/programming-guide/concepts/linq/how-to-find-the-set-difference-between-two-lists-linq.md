# How to: Find the Set Difference Between Two Lists (LINQ) (C#)
This example shows how to use LINQ to compare two lists of strings and output those lines that are in names1.txt but not in names2.txt.  
  
### To create the data files  
  
1.  Copy names1.txt and names2.txt to your solution folder as shown in [How to: Combine and Compare String Collections (LINQ) (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-combine-and-compare-string-collections-linq.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
class CompareLists  
{          
    static void Main()  
    {  
        // Create the IEnumerable data sources.  
        string[] names1 = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../names1.txt");  
        string[] names2 = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"../../../names2.txt");  
  
        // Create the query. Note that method syntax must be used here.  
        IEnumerable<string> differenceQuery =  
          names1.Except(names2);  
  
        // Execute the query.  
        Console.WriteLine("The following lines are in names1.txt but not names2.txt");  
        foreach (string s in differenceQuery)  
            Console.WriteLine(s);  
  
        // Keep the console window open in debug mode.  
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit");  
        Console.ReadKey();  
    }  
}  
/* Output:  
     The following lines are in names1.txt but not names2.txt  
    Potra, Cristina  
    Noriega, Fabricio  
    Aw, Kam Foo  
    Toyoshima, Tim  
    Guy, Wey Yuan  
    Garcia, Debra  
     */  
```  
  
 Some types of query operations in C#, such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Except%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Distinct%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Union%2A>, and <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Concat%2A>, can only be expressed in method-based syntax.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and `using` directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.
