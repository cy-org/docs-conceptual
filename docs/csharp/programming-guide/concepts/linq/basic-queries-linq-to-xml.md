|[How to: Find an Element with a Specific Child Element (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-find-an-element-with-a-specific-child-element.md)|Shows how to find a particular element that has a child element that has a specific value.|  
|[Querying an XDocument vs. Querying an XElement (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/querying-an-xdocument-vs-querying-an-xelement.md)|Explains the differences between writing queries on an XML tree that is rooted in <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> and writing queries on an XML tree that is rooted in <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument>.|
