# How to: Explicitly Implement Interface Members (C# Programming Guide)
This example declares an [interface](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface.md), `IDimensions`, and a class, `Box`, which explicitly implements the interface members `getLength` and `getWidth`. The members are accessed through the interface instance `dimensions`.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideInheritance#8](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-explicitly-implement-interface-members_1.cs)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
  
-   Notice that the following lines, in the `Main` method, are commented out because they would produce compilation errors. An interface member that is explicitly implemented cannot be accessed from a [class](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md) instance:  
  
     [!code-cs[csProgGuideInheritance#45](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-explicitly-implement-interface-members_2.cs)]  
  
-   Notice also that the following lines, in the `Main` method, successfully print out the dimensions of the box because the methods are being called from an instance of the interface:
