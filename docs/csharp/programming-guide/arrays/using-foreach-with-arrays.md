# Using foreach with Arrays (C# Programming Guide)
C# also provides the [foreach](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in.md) statement. This statement provides a simple, clean way to iterate through the elements of an array or any enumerable collection. The `foreach` statement processes elements in the order returned by the array or collection typeâ€™s enumerator, which is usually from the 0th element to the last. For example, the following code creates an array called `numbers` and iterates through it with the `foreach` statement:  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideArrays#28](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/using-foreach-with-arrays_1.cs)]  
  
 With multidimensional arrays, you can use the same method to iterate through the elements, for example:  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideArrays#29](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/using-foreach-with-arrays_2.cs)]  
  
 However, with multidimensional arrays, using a nested [for](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/for.md) loop gives you more control over the array elements.
