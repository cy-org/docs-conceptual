# Arrays as Objects (C# Programming Guide)
In C#, arrays are actually objects, and not just addressable regions of contiguous memory as in C and C++. <xref:System.Array> is the abstract base type of all array types. You can use the properties, and other class members, that <xref:System.Array> has. An example of this would be using the <xref:System.Array.Length%2A> property to get the length of an array. The following code assigns the length of the `numbers` array, which is `5`, to a variable called `lengthOfNumbers`:  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideArrays#3](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/arrays-as-objects_1.cs)]  
  
 The <xref:System.Array> class provides many other useful methods and properties for sorting, searching, and copying arrays.  
  
## Example  
 This example uses the <xref:System.Array.Rank%2A> property to display the number of dimensions of an array.
