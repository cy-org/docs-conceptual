# How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)(C# Programming Guide)
This example demonstrates how to create multicast delegates. A useful property of [delegate](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate.md) objects is that multiple objects can be assigned to one delegate instance by using the `+` operator. The multicast delegate contains a list of the assigned delegates. When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order. Only delegates of the same type can be combined.  
  
 The `-` operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a multicast delegate.
