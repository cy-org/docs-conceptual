# Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide)
To maintain type safety and security, C# does not support pointer arithmetic, by default. However, by using the [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, you can define an unsafe context in which pointers can be used. For more information about pointers, see the topic [Pointer types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/pointer-types.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In the common language runtime (CLR), unsafe code is referred to as unverifiable code. Unsafe code in C# is not necessarily dangerous; it is just code whose safety cannot be verified by the CLR. The CLR will therefore only execute unsafe code if it is in a fully trusted assembly. If you use unsafe code, it is your responsibility to ensure that your code does not introduce security risks or pointer errors.  
  
## Unsafe Code Overview  
 Unsafe code has the following properties:  
  
-   Methods, types, and code blocks can be defined as unsafe.  
  
-   In some cases, unsafe code may increase an application's performance by removing array bounds checks.  
  
-   Unsafe code is required when you call native functions that require pointers.  
  
-   Using unsafe code introduces security and stability risks.  
  
-   In order for C# to compile unsafe code, the application must be compiled with [/unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/unsafe-compiler-option.md).
