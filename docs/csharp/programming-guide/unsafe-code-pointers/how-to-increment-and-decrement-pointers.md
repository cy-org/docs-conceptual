# How to: Increment and Decrement Pointers (C# Programming Guide)
Use the increment and the decrement operators, `++` and `--`, to change the pointer location by [sizeof](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sizeof.md) (`pointer-type`) for a pointer of type pointer-type*. The increment and decrement expressions take the following form:  
  
```  
++p;  
p++;  
--p;  
p--;  
```  
  
 The increment and decrement operators can be applied to pointers of any type except the type `void*`.  
  
 The effect of applying the increment operator to a pointer of the type `pointer-type` is to add [sizeof](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sizeof.md) (`pointer-type`) to the address that is contained in the pointer variable.  
  
 The effect of applying the decrement operator to a pointer of the type `pointer-type` is to subtract `sizeof` (`pointer-type`) from the address that is contained in the pointer variable.  
  
 No exceptions are generated when the operation overflows the domain of the pointer, and the result depends on the implementation.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, you step through an array by incrementing the pointer by the size of `int`. With each step, you display the address and the content of the array element.
