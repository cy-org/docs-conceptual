# How to: Access a Member with a Pointer (C# Programming Guide)
To access a member of a struct that is declared in an unsafe context, you can use the member access operator as shown in the following example in which `p` is a pointer to a [struct](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/struct.md) that contains a member `x`.  
  
```  
CoOrds* p = &home;  
p -> x = 25; //member access operator ->  
```  
  
## Example  
 In this example, a [struct](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/struct.md), `CoOrds`, that contains the two coordinates `x` and `y` is declared and instantiated. By using the member access operator `->` and a pointer to the instance `home`, `x` and `y` are assigned values.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Notice that the expression `p->x` is equivalent to the expression `(*p).x`, and you can obtain the same result by using either of the two expressions.
