# How to: Use Pointers to Copy an Array of Bytes  (C# Programming Guide)
The following example uses pointers to copy bytes from one array to another.  
  
 This example uses the [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, which enables you to use pointers in the `Copy` method. The [fixed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/fixed-statement.md) statement is used to declare pointers to the source and destination arrays. This *pins* the location of the source and destination arrays in memory so that they will not be moved by garbage collection. The memory blocks for the arrays are unpinned when the `fixed` block is completed. Because the `Copy` method in this example uses the `unsafe` keyword, it must be compiled with the **/unsafe** compiler option. To set the option in Visual Studio, right-click the project name, and then click **Properties**. On the **Build** tab, select **Allow unsafe code**.
