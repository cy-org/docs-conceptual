# How to: Access an Array Element with a Pointer (C# Programming Guide)
In an unsafe context, you can access an element in memory by using pointer element access, as shown in the following example:  
  
```  
 char* charPointer = stackalloc char[123];  
for (int i = 65; i < 123; i++)  
{  
    charPointer[i] = (char)i; //access array elements  
}  
```  
  
 The expression in square brackets must be implicitly convertible to `int`, `uint`, `long`, or `ulong`. The operation p[e] is equivalent to *(p+e). Like C and C++, the pointer element access does not check for out-of-bounds errors.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, 123 memory locations are allocated to a character array, `charPointer`. The array is used to display the lowercase letters and the uppercase letters in two [for](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/for.md) loops.  
  
 Notice that the expression `charPointer[i]` is equivalent to the expression `*(charPointer + i)`, and you can obtain the same result by using either of the two expressions.
