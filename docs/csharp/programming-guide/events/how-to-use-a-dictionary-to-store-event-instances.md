# How to: Use a Dictionary to Store Event Instances (C# Programming Guide)
One use for `accessor-declarations` is to expose many events without allocating a field for each event, but instead using a Dictionary to store the event instances. This is only useful if you have many events, but you expect most of the events will not be implemented.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideEvents#9](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-a-dictionary-to-store-event-instances_1.cs)]
