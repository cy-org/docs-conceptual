# Enums

An ***enum type*** is a distinct value type with a set of named constants. You define enums when you need to define a type that can have a set of discrete values. They use one of the integral value types as their underlying storage. They provide semantic meaning to the discrete values.

The following example declares and uses an `enum` type named `Color` with three constant values, `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`.

[!code-csharp[EnumExample](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L3-L36)]

Each `enum` type has a corresponding integral type called the ***underlying type*** of the `enum` type. An `enum` type that does not explicitly declare an underlying type has an underlying type of `int`. An `enum` typeâ€™s storage format and range of possible values are determined by its underlying type. The set of values that an `enum` type can take on is not limited by its `enum` members. In particular, any value of the underlying type of an `enum` can be cast to the `enum` type and is a distinct valid value of that `enum` type.

The following example declares an `enum` type named `Alignment` with an underlying type of `sbyte`.

[!code-csharp[EnumStorage](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L38-L43)]

As shown by the previous example, an `enum` member declaration can include a constant expression that specifies the value of the member. The constant value for each `enum` member must be in the range of the underlying type of the `enum`. When an `enum` member declaration does not explicitly specify a value, the member is given the value zero (if it is the first member in the `enum` type) or the value of the textually preceding `enum` member plus one.

`Enum` values can be converted to integral values and vice versa using type casts. For example:

[!code-csharp[EnumStorage](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L49-L50)]

The default value of any `enum` type is the integral value zero converted to the `enum` type. In cases where variables are automatically initialized to a default value, this is the value given to variables of `enum` types. In order for the default value of an `enum` type to be easily available, the literal `0` implicitly converts to any `enum` type. Thus, the following is permitted.
