# Using F# on Azure

F# is a superb language for cloud programming and is frequently used to write web applications, cloud services, cloud-hosted microservices, and for scalable data processing.

In the following sections, you will find resources on how to use a range of Azure services with F#.

> [!NOTE]
> If a particular Azure service isn't in this documentation set, please consult either the Azure Functions or .NET documentation for that service. Some Azure services are language-independent and require no language-specific documentation and are not listed here.

## Using Azure Virtual Machines with F# #

Azure supports a wide range of virtual machine (VM) configurations, see [Linux and Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/).

To install F# on a virtual machine for execution, compilation and/or scripting see [Using F# on Linux](http://fsharp.org/use/linux) and [Using F# on Windows](http://fsharp.org/use/windows).


## Using Azure Functions with F# #

[Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. Your functions are connected to events in Azure storage and other cloud-hosted resources. Data flows into your F# functions via function arguments. You can use your development language of choice, trusting Azure to scale as needed.

Azure Functions support F# as a first-class language with efficient, reactive, scalable execution of F# code. See the [Azure Functions F# Developer Reference](/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-fsharp) for reference documentation on how to use F# with Azure Functions.

## Using Azure Storage with F# #

Azure Storage is a base layer of storage services for modern applications that rely on durability, availability, and scalability to meet the needs of customers. F# programs can interact directly with Azure storage services, using the techinques described in the following articles.

* [Get started with Azure Blob storage using F#](blob-storage.md)
* [Get started with Azure File storage using F#](file-storage.md)
* [Get started with Azure Queue storage using F#](queue-storage.md)
* [Get started with Azure Table storage using F#](table-storage.md)

Azure Storage can also be used in conjunction with Azure Functions through declarative configuration rather than explicit API calls. See [Azure Functions triggers and bindings for Azure Storage](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-storage) which includes F# examples.

## Using Azure App Service with F# #

[Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) is a cloud platform to build powerful web and mobile apps that connect to data anywhere, in the cloud or on-premises.

* [F# Azure Web API example](https://github.com/fsprojects/azure-webapi-example)
* [Hosting F# in a web application on Azure](https://github.com/isaacabraham/fsharp-demonstrator)

## Using Apache Spark with F# with Azure HDInsight

[Apache Spark for Azure HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/apache-spark/) is an open source processing framework that runs large-scale data analytics applications. Azure makes Apache Spark easy and cost effective to deploy. Develop your Spark application in F# using [Mobius](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mobius), a .NET API for Spark.

* [Implementing Spark Apps in F# using Mobius](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mobius/blob/master/notes/spark-fsharp-mobius.md)
* [Example F# Spark Apps using Mobius](https://github.com/Microsoft/Mobius/tree/master/examples/fsharp)

## Using Azure DocumentDB with F# #

[Azure DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/documentdb/) is a NoSQL service for highly available, globally distributed apps.

Azure DocumentDB can be used with F# in two ways:

1. Through the creation of F# Azure Functions which react to or cause changes to DocumentDB collections. See [Azure Function triggers for DocumentDB](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-documentdb), or
2. By using the [.NET SDK for Azure](/azure/documentdb/documentdb-get-started-quickstart). Note these examples are in C#.

## Using Azure Event Hubs with F# #

[Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) provide cloud-scale telemetry ingestion from websites, apps, and devices.

Azure Event Hubs can be used with F# in two ways:

1. Through the creation of F# Azure Functions which are triggered by events. See [Azure Function triggers for Event Hubs](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-event-hubs), or
2. By using the [.NET SDK for Azure](/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted). Note these examples are in C#.

## Using Azure Notification Hubs with F# #

[Azure Notification Hubs](/azure/notification-hubs/) are multiplatform, scaled-out push infrastructure that enable you to send mobile push notifications from any backend (in the cloud or on-premises) to any mobile platform.

Azure Notification Hubs can be used with F# in two ways:

1. Through the creation of F# Azure Functions which send results to a notification hub. See [Azure Function output triggers for Notification Hubs](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-notification-hubs), or
2. By using the [.NET SDK for Azure](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuremobile/2014/04/08/push-notifications-using-notification-hub-and-net-backend/). Note these examples are in C#.


## Implementing WebHooks on Azure with F# #

A [Webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) is a callback triggered via a web request. Webhooks are used by sites such as GitHub to signal events. 

Webhooks can be implemented in F# and hosted on Azure via an [Azure Function in F# with a Webhook Binding](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-http-webhook).

## Using Webjobs with F# #

[Webjobs](/azure/app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs) are programs you can run in your App Service web app in three ways: on demand, continuously, or on a schedule.

[Example F# Webjob](https://github.com/andredublin/fsharp-azure-webjob)

## Implementing Timers on Azure with F# #

Timer triggers call functions based on a schedule, one time or recurring.

Timers can be implemented in F# and hosted on Azure via an [Azure Function in F# with a Timer Trigger](/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-timer).

## Deploying and Managing Azure Resources with F# Scripts #

Azure VMs may be programmatically deployed and managed from F# scripts by using the Microsoft.Azure.Management packages and APIs. For example, see [Get Started with the Management Libraries for .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn722415.aspx) and [Using Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model).

Likewise, other Azure resources may also be deployed and managed from F# scripts using the same components. For example, you can create storage accounts, deploy Azure Cloud Services, create Azure DocumentDB instances and manage Azure Notifcation Hubs programmatically from F# scripts.

Using F# scripts to deploy and manage resources is not normally necessary. For example, Azure resources may also be deployed directy from JSON template descriptions, which can be parameterized. See [Azure Resource Manager Templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-template-best-practices) including examples such as the [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/).
