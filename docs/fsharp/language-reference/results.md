# Results

Starting with F# 4.1, there is a `Result<'T,'TFailure>` type which you can use for writing error-tolerant code which can be composed.

## Syntax

```fsharp
// The definition of Result in FSharp.Core
[<StructuralEquality; StructuralComparison>]
[<CompiledName("FSharpResult`2")>]
[<Struct>]
type Result<'T,'TError> = 
    | Ok of ResultValue:'T 
    | Error of ErrorValue:'TError
```

## Remarks

Note that the result type is a [struct discriminated union](discriminated-unions.md#struct-discriminated-unions), which is another feature introduced in F# 4.1.  Structural equality semantics apply here.

The `Result` type is typically used in monadic error-handling, which is often referred to as [Railway-oriented Programming](https://swlaschin.gitbooks.io/fsharpforfunandprofit/content/posts/recipe-part2.html) within the F# community.  The following trivial example demonstrates this approach.

```fsharp
// Define a simple type which has fields that can be validated
type Request = 
    { Name: string
      Email: string }

// Define some logic for what defines a valid name.
//
// Generates a Result wich is an Ok if the name valides;
// otherwise, it generates a Result which is an Error.
let validateName req =
    match req.Name with
    | null -> Error "No name found."
    | String.Empty -> Error "Name is empty."
    | "bananas" -> Error "Bananas is not a name."
    | _ -> Ok req

// Similarily, define some email validation logic.
let validateEmail req =
    match req.Email with
    | null -> Error "No email found."
    | String.Empty -> Error "Email is empty."
    | s when s.EndsWith("bananas.com") -> Error "No email from bananas.com is allowed."
    | _ -> OK req

let validateRequest reqResult =
    reqResult 
    |> Result.bind validateName
    |> Result.bind validateEmail

let test() = 
    // Now, create a Request and pattern match on the result.
    let req1 = { Name = "Phillip"; Email = "phillip@contoso.biz" }
    let res1 = validateRequest (OK req1)
    match res1 with
    | Ok req -> printfn "My request was valid! Name: %s Email %s" req1.Name req1.Email
    | Error e -> printfn "Error: %s" e
    // Prints " "My request was valid!  Name: Phillip Email: phillip@consoto.biz"

    let req2 = { Name = "Phillip"; Email = "phillip@bananas.biz" }
    let res2 = validateRequest (OK req2)
    match res2 with
    | Ok req -> printfn "My request was valid! Name: %s Email %s" req1.Name req1.Email
    | Error e -> printfn "Error: %s" e
    // Prints: "Error: No email from bananas.com is allowed."

test()
```

As you can see, it's quite easy to chain together various validation functions if you force them all to return a `Result`.  This lets you break up functionality like this into small pieces which are as composable as you need them to be.  This also has the added value of *enforcing* the use of [pattern matching](pattern-matching.md) at the end of a round of validation, which in turns enforces a higher degree of program correctness.
