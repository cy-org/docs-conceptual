# project.json and Visual Studio 2015 with .NET Core

On March 7, 2017, the .NET Core and ASP.NET Core documentation was updated for the release of Visual Studio 2017. The previous version of the documentation used Visual Studio 2015 and pre-release tooling based on the *project.json* file.

The documentation version from before the March 7 update is available in a PDF file and in a branch in the documentation repository.

## PDF files

The best source of the earlier documentation is PDF files:

* [.NET Core - PDF for project.json and Visual Studio 2015](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/project.json/net-core-project-json.pdf)
* [ASP.NET Core - PDF for project.json and Visual Studio 2015](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/aspnetcore/common/_static/aspnet-core-project-json.pdf)

## Documentation repository branch

You can view the earlier version of the documentation in the repository, but many links won't work and many code snippets are references that aren't expanded.

* [.NET Core - project.json branch in the documentation repository](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/tree/project.json/docs)
* [ASP.NET Core - project.json branch in the documentation repository](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/project.json/aspnetcore)

## Current version of the documentation

* [.NET Core documentation](./core/index.md)
* [ASP.NET Core documentation](/aspnet/core/)
