## Description

The `dotnet nuget locals` command clears or lists local NuGet resources in the http-request cache, temporary cache, or machine-wide global packages folder.

## Arguments

One of the following values:

* `all` - Indicates that the specified operation is applied to all cache types: http-request cache, global packages cache, and the temporary cache.
* `http-cache` - Indicates that the specified operation is applied only to the http-request cache. The other cache locations are not affected.

Displays the path for the local http-cache directory:

`dotnet nuget locals --list http-cache`
