## Description

`dotnet` is a generic driver for the Command Line Interface (CLI) toolchain. Invoked on its own, it provides brief usage instructions.

Each specific feature is implemented as a command. In order to use the feature, the command is specified after `dotnet`, such as [`dotnet build`](dotnet-build.md). All of the arguments following the command are its own arguments.

The only time `dotnet` is used as a command on its own is to run [framework-dependent apps](../deploying/index.md). Specify an application DLL after the `dotnet` verb to execute the application (for example, `dotnet myapp.dll`).

## Options

# [.NET Core 2.x](#tab/netcore2x)

`--additionaldeps <PATH>`

Path to additonal *deps.json* file.

`--additionalprobingpath <PATH>`

Path containing probing policy and assemblies to probe.

`-d|--diagnostics`

Enables diagnostic output.

`--fx-version <VERSION>`

Version of the installed .NET Core runtime to use to run the application.

`-h|--help`

Prints out a short help for the command. If using with `dotnet`, it also prints a list of the available commands.

`--info`

Prints out detailed information about the CLI tooling and the environment, such as the current operating system, commit SHA for the version, and other information.

`--roll-forward-on-no-candidate-fx`

 Rolls forward on no candidate shared framework.

`-v|--verbose`

Enables verbose output.

`--version`

Prints out the version of the .NET Core SDK in use.

# [.NET Core 1.x](#tab/netcore1x)

`--additionalprobingpath <PATH>`

Path containing probing policy and assemblies to probe.

`-d|--diagnostics`

Enables diagnostic output.

`--fx-version <VERSION>`

Version of the installed .NET Core runtime to use to run the application.

`-h|--help`

Prints out a short help for the command. If using with `dotnet`, it also prints a list of the available commands.

`--info`

Prints out detailed information about the CLI tooling and the environment, such as the current operating system, commit SHA for the version, and other information.

`-v|--verbose`

Enables verbose output.

`--version`

`DOTNET_SERVICING`

Specifies the location of the servicing index to use by the shared host when loading the runtime.

`DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`

Specifies whether data about the .NET Core tools usage is collected and sent to Microsoft.
