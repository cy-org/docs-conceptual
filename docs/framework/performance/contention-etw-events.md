# Contention ETW Events
Contention events are raised whenever there is contention for <xref:System.Threading.Monitor?displayProperty=fullName> locks or native locks used by the runtime. Contention occurs when a thread is waiting for a lock while another thread possesses the lock.  
  
 The following table shows the keyword under which contention events are raised, and the level of the events. (For more information, see [CLR ETW Keywords and Levels](../../../docs/framework/performance/clr-etw-keywords-and-levels.md).)  
  
|Keyword for raising the event|Level|  
|-----------------------------------|-----------|  
|`ContentionKeyword` (0x4000)|Informational (4)|  
  
 The following table shows event information.  
  
|Event|Event ID|Raised when|  
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|  
|`ContentionStart_V1`|81|Contention starts. This event does not include the amount of spinning time before a thread waits to acquire a lock; it is raised only when the thread waits to acquire a lock.|  
|`ContentionStop`|81|Contention ends.|  
  
 The following table shows event data.  
  
|Field name|Data type|Description|  
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|Flags|win:UInt8|0 for managed; 1 for native.|  
|ClrInstanceID|win:UInt16|Unique ID for the instance of CLR.|
