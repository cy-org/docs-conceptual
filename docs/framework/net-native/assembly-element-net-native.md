# &lt;Assembly&gt; Element (.NET Native)
Applies runtime reflection policy to all the types in a specified assembly.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<Assembly Name="assembly_name"   
          Activate="policy_setting"  
          Browse="policy_setting"  
          Dynamic="policy_setting"  
          Serialize="policy_setting" />  
          DataContractSerializer="policy_setting"  
          DataContractJsonSerializer="policy_setting"  
          XmlSerializer="policy_setting"  
          MarshalObject="policy_setting"  
          MarshalDelegate="policy_setting"  
          MarshalStructure="policy_setting" />  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Attribute type|Description|  
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Name`|General|Required attribute. Specifies the simple name of an assembly.|  
|`Activate`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors to enable activation of instances.|  
|`Browse`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls querying for information about or enumerating the types in the assembly, but does not enable any dynamic access at run time.|  
|`Dynamic`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to all type members, including constructors, methods, fields, properties, and events, to enable dynamic programming.|  
|`Serialize`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors, fields, and properties, to enable type instances to be serialized and deserialized by libraries such as the Newtonsoft JSON serializer.|  
|`DataContractSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for serialization that uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class.|  
|`DataContractJsonSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for JSON serialization that uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class.|  
|`XmlSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for XML serialization that uses the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class.|  
|`MarshalObject`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling reference types to Windows Runtime and COM.|  
|`MarshalDelegate`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling delegate types as function pointers to native code.|  
|`MarshalStructure`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling structures to native code.|  
  
## Name attribute  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*assembly_name*|The simple name of the assembly, without its file extension. This attribute corresponds to the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName.Name%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. For example, the name of an assembly named Extensions.dll is "Extensions".<br /><br /> You can also specify the literal string `*Application*` to apply policy to all assemblies in your app package, whether those assemblies are loaded or not. `*Application*` never applies policy to .NET Framework assemblies.|  
  
## All other attributes  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*policy_setting*|The setting to apply to this policy type for all types in the assembly. Possible values are `All`, `Auto`, `Excluded`, `Public`, `PublicAndInternal`, `Required Public`, `Required PublicAndInternal`, and `Required All`. For more information, see [Runtime Directive Policy Settings](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directive-policy-settings.md).|  
  
### Child Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<Namespace>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/namespace-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to all types in a child namespace.|  
|[\<Type>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/type-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a type.|  
|[\<TypeInstantiation>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/typeinstantiation-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a constructed generic type.|  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<Application>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/application-element-net-native.md)|Serves as a container for application-wide types and type members whose metadata is available for reflection at run time. The [\<Application>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/application-element-net-native.md) element can have zero, one, or more `<Assembly>` elements.|  
|[\<Library>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/library-element-net-native.md)|Defines the assembly that contains types and type members whose metadata is available for reflection at run time. The [\<Library>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/library-element-net-native.md) element can have zero or one `<Assembly>` element.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `<Assembly>` element defines runtime policy for all the types in an assembly. It differs from the [\<Library>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/library-element-net-native.md) element, which specifies a library but depends on its child elements to define runtime reflection policy. The `<Assembly>` element applies to all the types in an assembly unless they are overridden by a child element.  
  
 The following example shows how you can apply runtime policy to all the types in assemblies within your app package by assigning the `Name` attribute a value of "*Application\*". The `<Assembly>` element must be a child of the [\<Application>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/application-element-net-native.md) element.  
  
```xml  
<Directives xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/netfx/2013/01/metadata">   
  <Application>   
     <Assembly Name="*Application*" Dynamic="Required All" />   
  </Application>   
</Directives>  
```  
  
 The `Activate`, `Browse`, `Dynamic`, and `Serialize` attributes are all optional. However, the `<Assembly>` element must contain at least one of these attributes.
