# MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native)
**.NET for Windows apps for Windows 10, [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] only**  
  
 The exception that is thrown when metadata for a type or type member is available but its implementation has been removed.  
  
 **Namespace:** System.Reflection  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class is intended solely for internal use by the [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] tool chain. It is not intended for use in third-party code, nor should you handle the exception in your application code. Instead, you eliminate the exception by adding entries to your [runtime directives file](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md). For more information, see the Remarks section.  
  
## Syntax  
 [!code-csharp[ProjectN#22](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/projectn/cs/missingruntimeartifactexception_syntax1.cs#22)]  
  
 Note that the `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class derives from <xref:System.MemberAccessException>.  
  
 The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class has the following members:  
  
## Constructors  
  
|Constructor|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|`public MissingRuntimeArtifactException()`|Initializes a new instance of the `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class by using a system-supplied message that describes the error.<br /><br /> This constructor is for internal use by the [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] tool chain only.|  
|`public MissingRuntimeArtifactException(String message)`|Initializes a new instance of the `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class with a specified error message.<br /><br /> This constructor is for internal use by the [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] tool chain only.|  
  
## Properties  
  
|Property|Description|  
|--------------|-----------------|  
|`public IDictionary Data { get; }`|Gets a collection of key/value pairs that provide additional user-defined information about the exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public string HelpLink { get; set; }`|Gets or sets a link to the help file associated with this exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public int HResult { get; protected set; }`|Gets or sets the `HRESULT`, a coded numeric value that is assigned to a specific exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public Exception InnerException { get; }`|Gets the exception that caused the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public string Message { get; }`|Gets a message that describes the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public string Source { get; set; }`|Gets or sets the name of the application or object that caused the error. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public string StackTrace { get; }`|Gets a string representation of the immediate frames on the call stack. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public MethodBase TargetSite { get; }`|Gets the method that threw the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`public bool Equals(Object obj)`|Determines whether the specified object is equal to the current object.  (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  
|`protected void Finalize()`|Allows an object to try to free resources and perform other cleanup operations before it is reclaimed by garbage collection. (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  
|`public Exception GetBaseException()`|Returns the exception that is the root cause of one or more subsequent exceptions. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public int GetHashCode()`|Returns a hash code for a `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` instance.   (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  
|`public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)`|Sets a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo> object with information about the exception.  (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`public Type GetType()`|Gets the runtime type of the current instance. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
|`protected Object MemberwiseClone()`|Creates a shallow copy of the current object. (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  
|`public string ToString()`|Returns the string representation of the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
  
## Events  
  
|Event|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|`protected event EventHandler<SafeSerializationEventArgs> SerializeObjectState`|Occurs when an exception is serialized to create an exception state object that contains serialized data about the exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  
  
## Usage Details  
 The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to instantiate a type or invoke a type member and, although the type or member's metadata is present, its implementation has been removed.  
  
 Whether metadata and the implementation code to dynamically execute a method are available to an app at run time is defined by the runtime directives (XML configuration) file, *.rd.xml. To prevent your app from throwing this exception, you must modify \*.rd.xml to ensure that the metadata needed by a type or type member is present at run time. For information about the format of the \*.rd.xml file, see [Runtime Directives (rd.xml) Configuration File Reference](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Because this exception indicates that the implementation code needed by your application isn’t available at run time, you shouldn’t handle this exception in a `try`/`catch` block. Instead, you should diagnose the cause of the exception and eliminate it by using a runtime directives file. Typically, you eliminate this exception by specifying the appropriate `Activate` or `Dynamic` policy for a program element in the runtime directives file (*.rd.xml file). To get the entry that you can add to your runtime directives file that eliminates the exception, you can use one of two troubleshooters:  
>   
>  -   The [MissingMetadataException troubleshooter](http://dotnet.github.io/native/troubleshooter/type.html) for types.  
> -   The [MissingMetadataException troubleshooter](http://dotnet.github.io/native/troubleshooter/method.html) for methods.  
  
 The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class contains no unique members; all of its members are inherited from its base class, <xref:System.MemberAccessException>.
