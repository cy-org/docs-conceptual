# &lt;Subtypes&gt; Element (.NET Native)
Applies runtime policy to all classes inherited from the containing type.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<Subtypes Activate="policy_type"  
          Browse="policy_type"  
          Dynamic="policy_type"  
          Serialize="policy_type"   
          DataContractSerializer="policy_setting"  
          DataContractJsonSerializer="policy_setting"  
          XmlSerializer="policy_setting"  
          MarshalObject="policy_setting"  
          MarshalDelegate="policy_setting"  
          MarshalStructure="policy_setting" />  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Attribute type|Description|  
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Activate`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors to enable activation of instances.|  
|`Browse`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls querying for information about program elements, but does not enable any runtime access.|  
|`Dynamic`|Reflection|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to all type members, including constructors, methods, fields, properties, and events, to enable dynamic programming.|  
|`Serialize`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors, fields, and properties, to enable type instances to be serialized and deserialized by libraries such as the Newtonsoft JSON serializer.|  
|`DataContractSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for serialization that uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class.|  
|`DataContractJsonSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for JSON serialization that uses the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class.|  
|`XmlSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls policy for XML serialization that uses the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer?displayProperty=fullName> class.|  
|`MarshalObject`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling reference types to Windows Runtime and COM.|  
|`MarshalDelegate`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling delegate types as function pointers to native code.|  
|`MarshalStructure`|Interop|Optional attribute. Controls policy for marshaling value types to native code.|  
  
## All attributes  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|*policy_setting*|The setting to apply to this policy type. Possible values are `All`, `Auto`, `Excluded`, `Public`, `PublicAndInternal`, `Required Public`, `Required PublicAndInternal`, and `Required All`. For more information, see [Runtime Directive Policy Settings](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directive-policy-settings.md).|  
  
### Child Elements  
 None.  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<Type>](../../../docs/framework/net-native/type-element-net-native.md)|Applies reflection policy to a type and all its members.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `<Subtypes>` element applies policy to all the subtypes of its containing type. You use it when you want to apply different policies to derived types and their base classes.  
  
 The reflection, serialization, and interop attributes are all optional, although at least one should be present.  
  
## Example  
 The following example defines a class named `BaseClass` and a subclass named `Derived1`.  
  
 [!code-csharp[ProjectN_Reflection#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/projectn_reflection/cs/subtypes.cs#4)]  
  
 As shown in the following code, the runtime directives file explicitly sets the `Dynamic` and `Activate` policies for `BaseClass` to `Excluded`. Because of this, objects of type `BaseClass` cannot be instantiated dynamically or by calls to the `BaseClass` class constructor. However, the `<Subtypes>` element allows classes derived from `BaseClass` to be instantiated dynamically and through calls to their class constructors.  
  
```xml  
<Directives xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/netfx/2013/01/metadata">  
  <Application>  
   <Assembly Name="*Application*" Dynamic="Required All" />  
     <Type Name="Examples.Libraries.BaseClass" Activate ="Excluded" Dynamic="Excluded" >  
        <Subtypes Activate="Public" Dynamic ="Public"/>  
     </Type>  
  </Application>  
</Directives>  
```  
  
 Because of the `<Subtypes>` directive, the following code that instantiates a `Derived1` instance dynamically by calling the <xref:System.Activator.CreateInstance%28System.Type%29?displayProperty=fullName> method executes successfully.  The block variable here is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> object in a blank Windows Store app.
