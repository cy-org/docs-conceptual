# illegalPrepareConstrainedRegion MDA
The `illegalPrepareConstrainedRegion` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when a <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers.PrepareConstrainedRegions%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method call does not immediately precede the `try` statement of the exception handler. This restriction is at the MSIL level, so it is permissible to have non-code-generating source between the call and the `try`, such as comments.  
  
## Symptoms  
 A constrained execution region (CER) that is never treated as such, but as a simple exception handling block (`finally` or `catch`). As a consequence, the region does not run in the event of an out-of-memory condition or a thread abort.  
  
## Cause  
 The preparation pattern for a CER is not followed correctly.  This is an error event. The <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers.PrepareConstrainedRegions%2A> method call used to mark exception handlers as introducing a CER in their `catch`/`finally`/`fault`/`filter` blocks must be used immediately before the `try` statement.  
  
## Resolution  
 Ensure that the call to <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers.PrepareConstrainedRegions%2A> happens immediately before the `try` statement.  
  
## Effect on the Runtime  
 This MDA has no effect on the CLR.  
  
## Output  
 The MDA displays the name of the method calling the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers.PrepareConstrainedRegions%2A> method, the MSIL offset, and a message indicating the call does not immediately precede the beginning of the try block.  
  
## Configuration  
  
```xml  
<mdaConfig>  
  <assistants>  
    <illegalPrepareConstrainedRegion/>  
  </assistants>  
</mdaConfig>  
```  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates the pattern that causes this MDA to be activated.  
  
```  
void MethodWithInvalidPCR()  
{  
    RuntimeHelpers.PrepareConstrainedRegions();  
    Object o = new Object();  
    try  
    {  
        …  
    }  
    finally  
    {  
        …  
    }  
}  
```
