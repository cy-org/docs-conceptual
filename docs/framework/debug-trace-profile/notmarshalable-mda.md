# notMarshalable MDA
The `notMarshalable` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when the common language runtime (CLR) encounters a COM interface pointer without a valid registered proxy/stub or an incorrect `IMarshal` interface implementation while attempting to marshal the interface across contexts.  
  
## Symptoms  
 Calls are not serviced, or calls occur in the wrong context for COM interface pointers.  
  
## Cause  
 No valid registered proxy/stub or an incorrect `IMarshal` while attempting to marshal the interface across contexts.  
  
## Resolution  
 Make sure you have a proxy stub registered and that the `IMarshal` implementation is valid.  
  
## Effect on the Runtime  
 This MDA has no effect on the runtime.  
  
## Output  
 A message describing the problem.  
  
## Configuration  
  
```xml  
<mdaConfig>  
  <assistants>  
    <notMarshalable/>  
  </assistants>  
</mdaConfig>  
```
