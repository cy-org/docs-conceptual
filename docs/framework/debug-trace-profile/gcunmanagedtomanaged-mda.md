# gcUnmanagedToManaged MDA
The `gcUnmanagedToManaged` managed debugging assistant (MDA) causes a garbage collection whenever a thread transitions from unmanaged to managed code.  
  
## Symptoms  
 An application running unmanaged user components using COM and platform invoke is causing a nondeterministic access violation in the CLR.  
  
## Cause  
 If an application is running unmanaged user components, then those components might have corrupted the garbage-collected heap. This causes an access violation in the CLR when the garbage collector tries to walk the object graph.  
  
## Resolution  
 Enabling this assistant reduces the time between when the unmanaged component corrupts the garbage-collected heap and when the access violation happens by forcing a garbage collection to occur before every managed transition.  
  
## Effect on the Runtime  
 Causes a garbage collection whenever a thread transitions from unmanaged to managed code.  
  
## Output  
 This MDA produces no output.  
  
## Configuration  
  
```xml  
<mdaConfig>  
  <assistants>  
    <gcUnmanagedToManaged/>  
  </assistants>  
</mdaConfig>  
```
