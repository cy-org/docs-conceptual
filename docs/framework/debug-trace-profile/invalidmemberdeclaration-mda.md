# invalidMemberDeclaration MDA
The `invalidMemberDeclaration` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated to report an error that occurs while determining how to marshal the parameters of a member to be called from COM.  
  
## Symptoms  
 A failure HRESULT is returned to COM without the managed method having been called.  
  
## Cause  
 This is most likely due to an incompatible <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute> attribute on one of the parameters.  
  
## Resolution  
 Specify valid <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute> attributes on the parameters.  
  
## Effect on the Runtime  
 This MDA has no effect on the CLR.  
  
## Output  
 An informational message containing the member name, type name, and error message.  
  
## Configuration  
  
```xml  
<mdaConfig>  
  <assistants>  
    <invalidMemberDeclaration/>  
  </assistants>  
</mdaConfig>  
```
