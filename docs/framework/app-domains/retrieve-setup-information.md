# Retrieving Setup Information from an Application Domain
Each instance of an application domain consists of both properties and <xref:System.AppDomainSetup> information. You can retrieve setup information from an application domain using the <xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=fullName> class. This class provides several members that retrieve configuration information about an application domain.  
  
 You can also query the **AppDomainSetup** object for the application domain to obtain setup information that was passed to the domain when it was created.  
  
 The following example creates a new application domain and then prints several member values to the console.

 [!code-csharp[AppDomain_Setup#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AppDomain_Setup/CS/source2.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[AppDomain_Setup#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/AppDomain_Setup/VB/source2.vb#2)]  
  
 The following example sets, and then retrieves, setup information for an application domain. Note that `AppDomain.SetupInformation.ApplicationBase` gets the configuration information.
