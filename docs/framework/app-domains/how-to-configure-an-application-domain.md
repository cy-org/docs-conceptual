# How to: Configure an Application Domain
You can provide the common language runtime with configuration information for a new application domain using the <xref:System.AppDomainSetup> class. When creating your own application domains, the most important property is <xref:System.AppDomainSetup.ApplicationBase%2A>. The other **AppDomainSetup** properties are used mainly by runtime hosts to configure a particular application domain.  
  
 The **ApplicationBase** property defines the root directory of the application. When the runtime needs to satisfy a type request, it probes for the assembly containing the type in the directory specified by the **ApplicationBase** property.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A new application domain inherits only the **ApplicationBase** property of the creator.  
  
 The following example creates an instance of the **AppDomainSetup** class, uses this class to create a new application domain, writes the information to console, and then unloads the application domain.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[ADApplicationBase#2](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADApplicationBase/CPP/source2.cpp#2)]
 [!code-csharp[ADApplicationBase#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADApplicationBase/CS/source2.cs#2)]
