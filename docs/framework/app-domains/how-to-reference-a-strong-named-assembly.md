# How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly
The process for referencing types or resources in a strong-named assembly is usually transparent. You can make the reference either at compile time (early binding) or at run time.  
  
 A compile-time reference occurs when you indicate to the compiler that your assembly explicitly references another assembly. When you use compile-time referencing, the compiler automatically gets the public key of the targeted strong-named assembly and places it in the assembly reference of the assembly being compiled.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A strong-named assembly can only use types from other strong-named assemblies. Otherwise, the security of the strong-named assembly would be compromised.  
  
### To make a compile-time reference to a strong-named assembly  
  
1.  At the command prompt, type the following command:  
  
     \<*compiler command*> **/reference:**\<*assembly name*>  
  
     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language you are using, and *assembly name* is the name of the strong-named assembly being referenced. You can also use other compiler options, such as the **/t:library** option for creating a library assembly.  
  
 The following example creates an assembly called `myAssembly.dll` that references a strong-named assembly called `myLibAssembly.dll` from a code module called `myAssembly.cs`.  
  
```  
csc /t:library myAssembly.cs /reference:myLibAssembly.dll  
```  
  
### To make a run-time reference to a strong-named assembly  
  
1.  When you make a run-time reference to a strong-named assembly (for example, by using the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Load%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetType%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method), you must use the display name of the referenced strong-named assembly. The syntax of a display name is as follows:  
  
     \<*assembly name*>**,** \<*version number*>**,** \<*culture*>**,** \<*public key token*>  
  
     For example:  
  
    ```  
    myDll, Version=1.1.0.0, Culture=en, PublicKeyToken=03689116d3a4ae33   
    ```  
  
     In this example, `PublicKeyToken` is the hexadecimal form of the public key token. If there is no culture value, use `Culture=neutral`.  
  
 The following code example shows how to use this information with the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Load%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  
  
 [!code-cpp[Assembly.Load1#3](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.Load1/CPP/load2.cpp#3)]
 [!code-csharp[Assembly.Load1#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.Load1/CS/load2.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[Assembly.Load1#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.Load1/VB/load2.vb#3)]  
  
 You can print the hexadecimal format of the public key and public key token for a specific assembly by using the following [Strong Name (Sn.exe)](../../../docs/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md) command:  
  
 **sn -Tp \<** *assembly* **>**  
  
 If you have a public key file, you can use the following command instead (note the difference in case on the command-line option):  
  
 **sn -tp \<** *assembly* **>**
