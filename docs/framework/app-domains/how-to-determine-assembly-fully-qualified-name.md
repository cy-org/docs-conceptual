# How to: Determine an Assembly&#39;s Fully Qualified Name
To discover the fully qualified name of an assembly in the global assembly cache, use the Global Assembly Cache Tool ([Gacutil.exe](../../../docs/framework/tools/gacutil-exe-gac-tool.md)). See [How to: View the Contents of the Global Assembly Cache](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-view-the-contents-of-the-gac.md).  
  
 For assemblies that are not in the global assembly cache, you can get the fully qualified assembly name in a number of ways: can use code to output the information to the console or to a variable, or you can use the [Ildasm.exe (IL Disassembler)](../../../docs/framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler.md) to examine the assembly's metadata, which contains the fully qualified name.  
  
-   If the assembly is already loaded by the application, you can retrieve the value of the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.FullName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to get the fully qualified name. You can use this approach whether or not the assembly is in the GAC. The example provides an illustration.  
  
-   If you know the assembly's file system path, you can call the static (`Shared` in Visual Basic) <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to get the fully qualified assembly name. The following is a simple example.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Reflection.AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.reflection.assemblyname.getassemblyname/cs/getassemblyname1.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[System.Reflection.AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.reflection.assemblyname.getassemblyname/vb/getassemblyname1.vb#1)]  
  
-   You can use the [Ildasm.exe (IL Disassembler)](../../../docs/framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler.md) to examine the assembly's metadata, which contains the fully qualified name.  
  
 For more information about setting assembly attributes such as version, culture, and assembly name, see [Setting Assembly Attributes](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/set-assembly-attributes.md). For more information about giving an assembly a strong name, see [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/create-and-use-strong-named-assemblies.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following code example shows how to display the fully qualified name of an assembly containing a specified class to the console. Because it retrieves the name of an assembly that the app has already loaded, it does not matter whether the assembly is in the GAC.  
  
 [!code-cpp[Assembly.Fullname#2](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.FullName/CPP/example2.cpp#2)]
 [!code-csharp[Assembly.Fullname#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.FullName/CS/example2.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[Assembly.Fullname#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.FullName/VB/example2.vb#2)]
