# How to: Build a Single-File Assembly
A single-file assembly, which is the simplest type of assembly, contains type information and implementation, as well as the [assembly manifest](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-manifest.md). You can use command-line compilers or [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)] to create a single-file assembly. By default, the compiler creates an assembly file with an .exe extension.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)] for C# and Visual Basic can be used only to create single-file assemblies. If you want to create multifile assemblies, you must use command-line compilers or [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)] for Visual C++.  
  
 The following procedures show how to create single-file assemblies using command-line compilers.  
  
### To create an assembly with an .exe extension  
  
1.  At the command prompt, type the following command:  
  
     \<*compiler command*> \<*module name*>  
  
     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly.  
  
 The following example creates an assembly named `myCode.exe` from a code module called `myCode`.  
  
```csharp  
csc myCode.cs  
```  
  
```vb  
vbc myCode.vb  
```  
  
#### To create an assembly with an .exe extension and specify the output file name  
  
1.  At the command prompt, type the following command:  
  
     \<*compiler command*> **/out:**\<*file name*> \<*module name*>  
  
     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, *file name* is the output file name, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly.  
  
 The following example creates an assembly named `myAssembly.exe` from a code module called `myCode`.  
  
```csharp  
csc /out:myAssembly.exe myCode.cs  
```  
  
```vb  
vbc /out:myAssembly.exe myCode.vb  
```  
  
## Creating Library Assemblies  
 A library assembly is similar to a class library. It contains types that will be referenced by other assemblies, but it has no entry point to begin execution.  
  
#### To create a library assembly  
  
1.  At the command prompt, type the following command:  
  
     \<*compiler command*> **/t:library** \<*module name*>  
  
     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language used in your code module, and *module name* is the name of the code module to compile into the assembly. You can also use other compiler options, such as the **/out:** option.  
  
 The following example creates a library assembly named `myCodeAssembly.dll` from a code module called `myCode`.  
  
```csharp  
csc /out:myCodeLibrary.dll /t:library myCode.cs  
```  
  
```vb  
vbc /out:myCodeLibrary.dll /t:library myCode.vb  
```
