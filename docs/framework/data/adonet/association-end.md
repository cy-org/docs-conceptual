# association end
An *association end* identifies the [entity type](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) on one end of an [association](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md) and the number of entity type instances that can exist at that end of an association. Association ends are defined as part of an association; an association must have exactly two association ends. [Navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md) allow for navigation from one association end to the other.  
  
 An association end definition contains the following information:  
  
-   One of the entity types involved in the association. (Required)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For a given association, the entity type specified for each association end can be the same. This creates a self-association.  
  
-   An [association end multiplicity](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end-multiplicity.md) that indicates the number of entity type instances that can be at one end of the association. An association end multiplicity can have a value of one (1), zero or one (0..1), or many (*).  
  
-   A name for the association end. (Optional)  
  
-   Information about operations that are performed on the association end, such as cascade on delete. (Optional)  
  
## Example  
 The diagram below shows a conceptual model with two associations: `PublishedBy` and `WrittenBy`. The association ends for the `PublishedBy` association are the `Book` and `Publisher` entity types. The multiplicity of the `Publisher` end is one (1) and the multiplicity of the `Book` end is many (*), indicating that a publisher publishes many books and a book is published by one publisher.  
  
 ![Example Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/media/examplemodel.gif "ExampleModel")  
  
 The ADO.NET Entity Framework uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The CSDL below defines the `PublishedBy` association shown in the diagram above. Note that the type, name, and multiplicity of each association end are specified by XML attributes (the `Type`, `Role`, and `Multiplicity` attributes, respectively). Optional information about operations performed on an end is specified in an XML element (the `OnDelete` element). In this case, if a publisher is deleted, so are all associated books.
