# ISOF (Entity SQL)
Determines whether the type of an expression is of the specified type or one of its subtypes.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
expression IS [ NOT ] OF ( [ ONLY ] type )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `expression`  
 Any valid query expression to determine the type of.  
  
 NOT  
 Negates the EDM.Boolean result of IS OF.  
  
 ONLY  
 Specifies that IS OF returns `true` only if `expression` is of type `type` and not any of one its subtypes.  
  
 `type`  
 The type to test `expression` against. The type must be namespace-qualified.  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if `expression` is of type T and T is either a base type, or a derived type of `type`; null if `expression` is null at runtime; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The expressions `expression IS NOT OF (type)` and `expression IS NOT OF (ONLY type)` are syntactically equivalent to `NOT (expression IS OF (type))` and `NOT (expression IS OF (ONLY type))`, respectively.  
  
 The following table shows the behavior of `IS OF` operator over some typical- and corner patterns. All exceptions are thrown from the client side before the provider gets invoked:  
  
|Pattern|Behavior|  
|-------------|--------------|  
|null IS OF (EntityType)|Throws|  
|null IS OF (ComplexType)|Throws|  
|null IS OF (RowType)|Throws|  
|TREAT (null AS EntityType) IS OF (EntityType)|Returns DBNull|  
|TREAT (null AS ComplexType) IS OF (ComplexType)|Throws|  
|TREAT (null AS RowType) IS OF (RowType)|Throws|  
|EntityType IS OF (EntityType)|Returns true/false|  
|ComplexType IS OF (ComplexType)|Throws|  
|RowType IS OF (RowType)|Throws|  
  
## Example  
 The following [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query uses the IS OF operator to determine the type of a query expression, and then uses the TREAT operator to convert an object of the type Course to a collection of objects of the type OnsiteCourse. The query is based on the [School Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/859a9587-81ea-4a45-9bc0-f8d330e1adac).
