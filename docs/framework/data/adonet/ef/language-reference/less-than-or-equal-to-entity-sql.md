# &lt;= (Less Than or Equal To) (Entity SQL)
Compares two expressions to determine whether the left expression has a value less than or equal to the right expression.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
expression <= expression  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `expression`  
 Any valid expression. Both expressions must have implicitly convertible data types.  
  
## Result Types  
 `true` if the left expression has a value less than or equal to the right expression; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Example  
 The following Entity SQL query uses <= comparison operator to compare two expressions to determine whether the left expression has a value less than or equal to the right expression. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  
  
2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
