# How to: Call Canonical Functions
The <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions> class contains methods that expose canonical functions to use in LINQ to Entities queries. For information about canonical functions, see [Canonical Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/canonical-functions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.AsUnicode%2A> and <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.AsNonUnicode%2A> methods in the <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions> class do not have canonical function equivalents.  
  
 Canonical functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value (also known as aggregate canonical functions) can be directly invoked. Other canonical functions can only be called as part of a LINQ to Entities query. To call an aggregate function directly, you must pass an <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> to the function. For more information, see the second example below.  
  
 You can call some canonical functions by using common language runtime (CLR) methods in LINQ to Entities queries. For a list of CLR methods that map to canonical functions, see [CLR Method to Canonical Function Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/clr-method-to-canonical-function-mapping.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f16cd988-673f-4376-b034-129ca93c7832). The example executes a LINQ to Entities query that uses the <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.DiffDays%2A> method to return all products for which the difference between `SellEndDate` and `SellStartDate` is less than 365 days:

## Example  
 The following example uses the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f16cd988-673f-4376-b034-129ca93c7832). The example calls the aggregate <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.StandardDeviation%2A> method directly to return the standard deviation of `SalesOrderHeader` subtotals. Note that an <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> is passed to the function, which allows it to be called without being part of a LINQ to Entities query.
