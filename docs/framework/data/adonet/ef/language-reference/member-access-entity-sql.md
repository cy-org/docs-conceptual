# . (Member Access) (Entity SQL)
The dot operator (.) is the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] member access operator. You use the member access operator to yield the value of a property or field of an instance of structural conceptual model type.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
expression.identifier  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `expression`  
 An instance of a structural conceptual model type.  
  
 `identifier`  
 A property or field that belongs to an object instance.  
  
## Remarks  
 The dot (.) operator may be used to extract fields from a record, similar to extracting properties of a complex or entity type. For example, if n of type Name is a member of type Person, and p is an instance of type Person, then p.n is a legal member access expression that yields a value of type Name.  
  
 `select p.Name.FirstName from LOB.Person as p`
