# Constant Expressions
A constant expression consists of a constant value. Constant values are directly converted to constant command tree expressions, without any translation on the client. This includes expressions that result in a constant value. Therefore, data source behavior should be expected for all expressions involving constants. This can result in behavior that differs from CLR behavior.  
  
 The following example shows a constant expression that is evaluated on the server.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ConstantExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#constantexpression)]
 [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ConstantExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#constantexpression)]  
  
 [!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)] does not support using a user class as a constant. However, a property reference on a user class is considered a constant, and will be converted to a command tree constant expression and executed on the data source.
