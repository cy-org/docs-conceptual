# / (Divide) (Entity SQL)
Divides one number by another.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
dividend / divisor  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `dividend`  
 The numeric expression to divide. `dividend` is any valid expression of any one of the numeric data types.  
  
 `divisor`  
 The numeric expression to divide the dividend by. `divisor` is any valid expression of any one of the numeric data types.  
  
## Result Types  
 The data type that results from the implicit type promotion of the two arguments. For more information about implicit type promotion, see [Type System](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/type-system-entity-sql.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following Entity SQL query uses the / arithmetic operator to divide one numer by another. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  
  
2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
