# SET (Entity SQL)
The SET expression is used to convert a collection of objects into a set by yielding a new collection with all duplicate elements removed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
SET ( expression )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `expression`  
 Any valid query expression that returns a collection.  
  
## Remarks  
 The set expression `SET(c)` is logically equivalent to the following select statement:  
  
```  
SELECT VALUE DISTINCT c FROM c  
```  
  
 `SET` is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. See [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md) for precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators.  
  
## Example  
 The following Entity SQL query uses the SET expression to convert a collection of objects into a set. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns PrimitiveType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-primitivetype-results.md).  
  
2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecutePrimitiveTypeQuery` method:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts 2#SET](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts 2/cs/entitysql.cs#set)]
