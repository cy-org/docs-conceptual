# ISNULL (Entity SQL)
Determines if a query expression is null.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
expression IS [ NOT ] NULL  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `expression`  
 Any valid query expression. Cannot be a collection, have collection members, or a record type with collection type properties.  
  
 NOT  
 Negates the EDM.Boolean result of IS NULL.  
  
## Return Value  
 `true` if `expression` returns null; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use `IS NULL` to determine if the element of an outer join is null:  
  
```  
select c   
      from LOB.Customers as c left outer join LOB.Orders as o   
                              on c.ID = o.CustomerID    
      where o is not null and o.OrderQuantity = @x  
```  
  
 Use `IS NULL` to determine if a member has an actual value:  
  
```  
select c from LOB.Customer as c where c.DOB is not null  
```  
  
 The following table shows the behavior of `IS NULL` over some patterns. All exceptions are thrown from the client side before the provider gets invoked:  
  
|Pattern|Behavior|  
|-------------|--------------|  
|null IS NULL|Returns `true`.|  
|TREAT (null AS EntityType) IS NULL|Returns `true`.|  
|TREAT (null AS ComplexType) IS NULL|Throws an error.|  
|TREAT (null AS RowType) IS NULL|Throws an error.|  
|EntityType IS NULL|Returns `true` or `false`.|  
|ComplexType IS NULL|Throws an error.|  
|RowType IS NULL|Throws an error.|  
  
## Example  
 The following [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query uses the IS NOT NULL operator to determine if a query expression is not null. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  
  
2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
