# FLATTEN (Entity SQL)
Converts a collection of collections into a flattened collection. The new collection contains all the same elements as the old collection, but without a nested structure.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
FLATTEN ( collection )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `collection`  
 Any valid expression that returns a collection of value collections to flatten into a single collection.  
  
## Remarks  
 `FLATTEN` is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. See [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md) for precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators.  
  
## Example  
 The following Entity SQL query uses the `FLATTEN` operator to convert a collection of collections into a flattened collection. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  
  
2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
