# Parameters (Entity SQL)
Parameters are variables that are defined outside [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)], usually through a binding API that is used by a host language. Each parameter has a name and a type. Parameter names are defined in query expressions with the at (@) symbol as a prefix. This disambiguates them from the names of properties or other names that are defined in the query.  
  
 The host-language binding API provides APIs for binding parameters.  
  
## Example  
  
```  
select c   
      from LOB.Customers as c   
      where c.Name = @name  
```
