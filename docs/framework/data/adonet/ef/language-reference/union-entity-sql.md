# UNION (Entity SQL)
Combines the results of two or more queries into a single collection.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
expression  
UNION [ ALL ]  
expression  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `expression`  
 Any valid query expression that returns a collection to combine with the collection All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  
  
 UNION  
 Specifies that multiple collections are to be combined and returned as a single collection.  
  
 ALL  
 Specifies that multiple collections are to be combined and returned as a single collection, including duplicates. If not specified, duplicates are removed from the result collection.  
  
## Return Value  
 A collection of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  
  
## Remarks  
 UNION is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. For precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators, see [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following Entity SQL query uses the UNION ALL operator to combine the results of two queries into a single collection. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  
  
1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  
  
2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:
