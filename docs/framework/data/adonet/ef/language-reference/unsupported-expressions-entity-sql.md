# Unsupported Expressions (Entity SQL)
This topic describes [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] expressions that are not supported in [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]. For more information, see [How Entity SQL Differs from Transact-SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/how-entity-sql-differs-from-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Quantified Predicates  
 [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] allows constructs of the following form:  
  
```  
sal > all (select salary from employees)  
sal > any (select salary from employees)  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)], however, does not support such constructs. Equivalent expressions can be written in [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] as follows:  
  
```  
not exists(select 0 from employees as e where sal > e.salary)  
exists(select 0 from employees as e where sal > e.salary)  
```  
  
## * Operator  
 [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] supports the use of the * operator in the SELECT clause to indicate that all columns should be projected out. This is not supported in [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)].
