# SQL Generation
When you write a provider for the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)], you must translate [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] command trees into SQL that a specific database can understand, such as Transact-SQL for SQL Server or PL/SQL for Oracle. In this section, you will learn how to develop a SQL generation component (for SELECT queries) for an [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] provider. For information about insert, update, and delete queries, see [Modification SQL Generation](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/modification-sql-generation.md).  
  
 To understand this section, you should be familiar with the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] and the ADO.NET Provider Model. You should also understand command trees and <xref:System.Data.Common.CommandTrees.DbExpression>.  
  
## The Role of the SQL Generation Module  
 The SQL generation module of an [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] provider translates a given query command tree into a single SQL SELECT statement that targets a SQL:1999-compliant database. The generated SQL should have as few nested queries as possible. The SQL generation module should not simplify the output query command tree. The [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] will do this, for example by eliminating joins and collapsing consecutive filter nodes.  
  
 The <!--zz<xref:System.Data.Common.DBProviderServices> --> `System.Data.Common.DBProviderServices`  class is the starting point for accessing the SQL generation layer to convert command trees into <!--zz<xref:System.Data.Common.DbCommands>--> `System.Data.Common.DbCommands`.
