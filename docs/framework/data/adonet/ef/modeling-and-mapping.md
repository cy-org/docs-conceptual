# Modeling and Mapping
In the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)], you can define the conceptual model, storage model, and the mapping between the two in the way that best suits your application. The Entity Data Model Tools in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] allow you to create an .[edmx file](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f4c8e7ce-1db6-417e-9759-15f8b55155d4) from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes.  
  
 Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can also create a model programmatically using Code First development. There are two different scenarios for Code First development. In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.  
  
 For more information, see [Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016).  
  
 You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. The EdmGen.exe generates the .csdl, .ssdl, and .msl files from an existing data source. You can also manually create the model and mapping content. For more information, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md).
