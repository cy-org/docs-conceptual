# Entity Framework Terminology
This topic defines terms frequently referenced in [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] documentation. Links are provided to relevant topics where additional information is available.  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|----------|----------------|  
|association|The definition of a relationship between entity types.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Association Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c305169a-8af7-432f-9ba7-800a163aed41) and [association type](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md).|  
|association set|A logical container for instances of associations of the same type.<br /><br /> For more information, see [AssociationSet Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/512cbb75-cebe-4f3f-970d-3419deeff684) and [association set](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-set.md).|  
|Code First|Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can create a model programmatically using Code First development. There are two different scenarios for Code First development. In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.<br /><br /> Note, that Code First development is part of the [Entity Framework 5.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234900). The Entity Framework 5.0 is not part of the .NET Framework, but is built on .NET Framework 4.5. The Entity Framework 5.0 is available as the [‘Entity Framework’](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215714)[NuGet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232488) package. For more information, see [Entity Framework Releases and Versioning](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234899).|  
|command tree|A common, programmatic representation of all [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] queries that are composed of one or more expressions.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Entity Framework Overview](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/overview.md).|  
|complex type|A [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] class that represents a complex property as defined in the conceptual model. Complex types enable scalar properties to be organized within entities. Complex objects are instances of complex types. For more information, see [ComplexType Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f1c2f311-9889-4b87-abd8-a94f322052e3) and [complex type](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/complex-type.md).|  
|ComplexType|The specification for a data type that represents a non-scalar property of an entity type that does not have a key property.<br /><br /> For more information, see [ComplexType Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f1c2f311-9889-4b87-abd8-a94f322052e3) and [complex type](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/complex-type.md).|  
|conceptual model|An abstract specification for the entity types, complex types, associations, entity containers, entity sets, and association sets in the domain of an application in the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)].

|concurrency|A process that allows multiple users to access and change shared data at the same time. By default, the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] implements an optimistic concurrency model.|  
|direction|Refers to the asymmetrical nature of some associations. Direction is specified with `FromRole` and `ToRole` attributes of a `NavigationProperty` or `ReferentialConstraint` element in a schema.<br /><br /> For more information, see [NavigationProperty Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5829a238-a50e-4c81-901d-7b54fc00f27e) and [navigation property](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md).|

|entity type|A [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] class that represents an entity as it is defined in the conceptual model. Entity types may have scalar, complex, and navigation properties. Objects are instances of entity types. For more information, see [Working with Objects](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/working-with-objects.md).|

|foreign key association|An association between entities that is managed through foreign key properties.|  
|identifying relationship|A relationship where the primary key of the principal entity is part of the primary key of the dependent entity. In this kind of relationship, the dependent entity cannot exist without the principal entity.|

|modification functions|Stored procedures that are used to insert, update, and delete data that is in the data source. These functions are used in place of [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] generated commands. Modification functions are defined by the `Function` element in the storage model. The [ModificationFunctionMapping](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b44b5b13-9937-448b-ba36-7a0cfefea782) element maps these modification functions to insert, update, and delete operations against entities that are defined in the conceptual model.|
