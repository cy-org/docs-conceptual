# How to: Detect and Resolve Conflicting Submissions
[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] provides many resources for detecting and resolving conflicts that stem from multi-user changes to the database. For more information, see [How to: Manage Change Conflicts](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-manage-change-conflicts.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows a `try`/`catch` block that catches a <xref:System.Data.Linq.ChangeConflictException> exception. Entity and member information for each conflict is displayed in the console window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You must include the `using System.Reflection` directive (`Imports System.Reflection` in Visual Basic) to support the information retrieval. For more information, see <xref:System.Reflection>.
