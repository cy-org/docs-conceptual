# Unsupported Functionality
In LINQ to SQL, the following SQL functionality cannot be exposed through translation of existing common language runtime (CLR) and .NET Framework constructs:  
  
-   `STDDEV`  
  
-   `LIKE`  
  
     Although `LIKE` is not supported through direct translation, similar functionality exists in the <xref:System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlMethods> class. For more information, see <xref:System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlMethods.Like%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
-   `DATEDIFF`  
  
     LINQ to SQL has limited support for `DATEDIFF`. Similar functionality exists in the <xref:System.Data.Linq.SqlClient.SqlMethods> class.  
  
-   `ROUND`  
  
     LINQ to SQL has limited support for `ROUND`. For more information, see [System.Math Methods](system-math-methods.md).
