# How to: Use Stored Procedures Mapped for Sequential Result Shapes
This kind of stored procedure can generate more than one result shape, but you know in what order the results are returned. Contrast this scenario with the scenario where you do not know the sequence of the returns. For more information, see [How to: Use Stored Procedures Mapped for Multiple Result Shapes](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-use-stored-procedures-mapped-for-multiple-result-shapes.md).  
  
## Example  
 Here is the T-SQL of a stored procedure that returns multiple result shapes sequentially:  
  
```  
CREATE PROCEDURE MultipleResultTypesSequentially  
AS  
select * from products  
select * from customers  
```  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqSprox#6](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqSprox/cs/northwind-sprox.cs#6)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqSprox#6](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqSprox/vb/northwind-sprox.vb#6)]  
  
## Example  
 You would use code similar to the following to execute this stored procedure.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqSprox#7](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqSprox/cs/Program.cs#7)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqSprox#7](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqSprox/vb/Module1.vb#7)]
