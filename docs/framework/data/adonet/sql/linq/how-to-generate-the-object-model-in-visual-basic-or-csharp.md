# How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C# #
In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], an object model in your own programming language is mapped to a relational database. Two tools are available for automatically generating a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or C# model from the metadata of an existing database.  
  
-   If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to generate an object model. The [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] provides a rich user interface to help you generate a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model.  
  
-   The SQLMetal command-line tool. For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you do not have an existing database and want to create one from an object model, you can create your object model by using your code editor and <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.CreateDatabase%2A>. For more information, see [How to: Dynamically Create a Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-dynamically-create-a-database.md).  
  
 Documentation for the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] provides examples of how to generate a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or C# object model by using the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)]. The following information provide examples of how to use the SQLMetal command-line tool. For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md).  
  
## Example  
 The SQLMetal command line shown in the following example produces [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] code as the attribute-based object model of the Northwind sample database. Stored procedures and functions are also rendered.  
  
```  
sqlmetal /code:northwind.vb /language:vb "c:\northwnd.mdf" /sprocs /functions  
```  
  
## Example  
 The SQLMetal command line shown in the following example produces C# code as the attribute-based object model of the Northwind sample database. Stored procedures and functions are also rendered, and table names are automatically pluralized.  
  
```  
sqlmetal /code:northwind.cs /language:csharp "c:\northwnd.mdf" /sprocs /functions /pluralize  
```
