# Compute the Sum of Values in a Numeric Sequence
Use the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum%2A> operator to compute the sum of numeric values in a sequence.  
  
 Note the following characteristics of the `Sum` operator in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]:  
  
-   The Standard Query Operator aggregate operator `Sum` evaluates to zero for an empty sequence or a sequence that contains only nulls. In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], the semantics of SQL are left unchanged. For this reason, `Sum` evaluates to null instead of to zero for an empty sequence or for a sequence that contains only nulls.  
  
-   SQL limitations on intermediate results apply to aggregates in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]. Sum of 32-bit integer quantities is not computed by using 64-bit results, and overflow can occur for the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translation of `Sum`. This possibility exists even if the Standard Query Operator implementation does not cause an overflow for the corresponding in-memory sequence.  
  
## Example  
 The following example finds the total freight of all orders in the `Order` table.  
  
 If you run this query against the Northwind sample database, the output is: `64942.6900`.

 [!code-vb[DLinqQueryExamples#12](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQueryExamples/vb/Module1.vb#12)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example finds the total number of units on order for all products.  
  
 If you run this query against the Northwind sample database, the output is: `780`.  
  
 Note that you must cast `short` types (for example, `UnitsOnOrder`) because `Sum` has no overload for short types.
