# How to: Update Rows in the Database
You can update rows in a database by modifying member values of the objects associated with the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601> collection and then submitting the changes to the database. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates your changes into the appropriate SQL `UPDATE` commands.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can override [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` database operations. For more information, see [Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/customizing-insert-update-and-delete-operations.md).  
>   
>  Developers using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to develop stored procedures for the same purpose.  
  
 The following steps assume that a valid <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> connects you to the Northwind database. For more information, see [How to: Connect to a Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-connect-to-a-database.md).  
  
### To update a row in the database  
  
1.  Query the database for the row to be updated.  
  
2.  Make desired changes to member values in the resulting [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object.  
  
3.  Submit the changes to the database.  
  
## Example  
 The following example queries the database for order #11000, and then changes the values of `ShipName` and `ShipVia` in the resulting `Order` object. Finally, the changes to these member values are submitted to the database as changes in the `ShipName` and `ShipVia` columns.
