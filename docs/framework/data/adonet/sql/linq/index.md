# LINQ to SQL
[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] is a component of [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 3.5 that provides a run-time infrastructure for managing relational data as objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Relational data appears as a collection of two-dimensional tables (*relations* or *flat files*), where common columns relate tables to each other. To use [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] effectively, you must have some familiarity with the underlying principles of relational databases.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], the data model of a relational database is mapped to an object model expressed in the programming language of the developer. When the application runs, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates into SQL the language-integrated queries in the object model and sends them to the database for execution. When the database returns the results, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates them back to objects that you can work with in your own programming language.  
  
 Developers using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] typically use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)], which provides a user interface for implementing many of the features of [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)].  
  
 The documentation that is included with this release of [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] describes the basic building blocks, processes, and techniques you need for building [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] applications. You can also search the MSDN Library for specific issues, and you can participate in the [LINQ Forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76488), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts. Finally, the [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93205) white paper details [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and C# code examples.
