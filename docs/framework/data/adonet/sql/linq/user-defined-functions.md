# User-Defined Functions
[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] uses methods in your object model to represent user-defined functions. You designate methods as functions by applying the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.FunctionAttribute> attribute and, where required, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.ParameterAttribute> attribute. For more information, see [The LINQ to SQL Object Model](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/the-linq-to-sql-object-model.md).  
  
 To avoid an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>, user-defined functions in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] must be in one of the following forms:  
  
-   A function wrapped as a method call having the correct mapping attributes. For more information, see [Attribute-Based Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/attribute-based-mapping.md).  
  
-   A static SQL method specific to [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)].  
  
-   A function supported by a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] method.  
  
 The topics in this section show how to form and call these methods in your application if you write the code yourself. Developers using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] would typically use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to map user-defined functions.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-use-scalar-valued-user-defined-functions.md)  
 Describes how to implement a function that returns scalar values.  
  
 [How to: Use Table-Valued User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-use-table-valued-user-defined-functions.md)  
 Describes how to implement a function that returns table values.  
  
 [How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-call-user-defined-functions-inline.md)  
 Describes how to make inline calls to functions and the differences in execution when the call is made inline.
