# How to: Connect to a Database
The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is the main conduit by which you connect to a database, retrieve objects from it, and submit changes back to it. You use the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> just as you would use an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection>. In fact, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is initialized with a connection or connection string that you supply. For more information, see [DataContext Methods (O/R Designer)](/visualstudio/data-tools/datacontext-methods-o-r-designer).  
  
 The purpose of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is to translate your requests for objects into SQL queries to be made against the database, and then to assemble objects out of the results. The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> enables [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] by implementing the same operator pattern as the Standard Query Operators, such as `Where` and `Select`.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Maintaining a secure connection is of the highest importance. For more information, see [Security in LINQ to SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/security-in-linq-to-sql.md).  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is used to connect to the Northwind sample database and to retrieve rows of customers whose city is London.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/cs/Program.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/vb/Module1.vb#1)]  
  
 Each database table is represented as a `Table` collection available by way of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.GetTable%2A> method, by using the entity class to identify it.  
  
## Example  
 Best practice is to declare a strongly typed <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> instead of relying on the basic <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> class and the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.GetTable%2A> method. A strongly typed <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> declares all `Table` collections as members of the context, as in the following example.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/cs/Program.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/vb/Module1.vb#2)]  
  
 You can then express the query for customers from London more simply as:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/cs/Program.cs#5)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/vb/Module1.vb#5)]
