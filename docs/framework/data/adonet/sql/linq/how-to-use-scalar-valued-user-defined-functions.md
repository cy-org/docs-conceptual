# How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions
You can map a client method defined on a class to a user-defined function by using the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.FunctionAttribute> attribute. Note that the body of the method constructs an expression that captures the intent of the method call, and passes that expression to the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> for translation and execution.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Direct execution occurs only if the function is called outside a query. For more information, see [How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-call-user-defined-functions-inline.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following SQL code presents a scalar-valued user-defined function `ReverseCustName()`.  
  
```  
CREATE FUNCTION ReverseCustName(@string varchar(100))  
RETURNS varchar(100)  
AS  
BEGIN  
    DECLARE @custName varchar(100)  
    -- Implementation left as exercise for users.  
    RETURN @custName  
END  
```  
  
 You would map a client method such as the following for this code:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DLinqUDFS#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/cs/northwind-tfunc.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[DLinqUDFS#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/vb/northwind-tfunc.vb#3)]
