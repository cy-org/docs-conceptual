 Describes how to use the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> class to connect to a database.  
  
 [How to: Directly Execute SQL Commands](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-directly-execute-sql-commands.md)  
 Describes how you can use <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.ExecuteCommand%2A> to send SQL-language commands.  
  
 [How to: Reuse a Connection Between an ADO.NET Command and a DataContext](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-reuse-a-connection-between-an-ado-net-command-and-a-datacontext.md)  
 Provides examples of how to use an existing [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] connection in a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] application.
