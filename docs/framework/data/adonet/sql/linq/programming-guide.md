# Programming Guide
This section contains information about how to create and use your [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model. If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can also use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to perform many of these same tasks.  
  
 You can also search the MSDN Library for specific issues, and you can participate in the [LINQ Forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76488), where you can discuss more complex topics in detail with experts. Finally, the [LINQ to SQL: .NET Language-Integrated Query for Relational Data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93205) white paper details [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology, complete with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and C# code examples.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Creating the Object Model](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/creating-the-object-model.md)  
 Describes how to generate an object model.  
  
 [Communicating with the Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/communicating-with-the-database.md)  
 Describes how to use a <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object as a conduit to the database.  
  
 [Querying the Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/querying-the-database.md)  
 Describes how to execute queries in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], and provides many examples.  
  
 [Making and Submitting Data Changes](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/making-and-submitting-data-changes.md)  
 Describes how change data in the database.  
  
 [Debugging Support](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/debugging-support.md)  
 Describes the support available for debugging [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] projects.  
  
 [Background Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/background-information.md)  
 Includes additional items, such as concurrency conflict resolution, creating new databases, and more, for more advanced users.

 Provides links to topics that explain the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] technology and demonstrate features.  
  
 [Stored Procedures](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/stored-procedures.md)
