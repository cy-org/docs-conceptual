# How to: Delete Rows From the Database
You can delete rows in a database by removing the corresponding [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] objects from their table-related collection. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates your changes to the appropriate SQL `DELETE` commands.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] does not support or recognize cascade-delete operations. If you want to delete a row in a table that has constraints against it, you must complete either of the following tasks:  
  
-   Set the `ON DELETE CASCADE` rule in the foreign-key constraint in the database.  
  
-   Use your own code to first delete the child objects that prevent the parent object from being deleted.  
  
 Otherwise, an exception is thrown. See the second code example later in this topic.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can override [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` database operations. For more information, see [Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/customizing-insert-update-and-delete-operations.md).  
>   
>  Developers using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to develop stored procedures for the same purpose.  
  
 The following steps assume that a valid <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> connects you to the Northwind database. For more information, see [How to: Connect to a Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-connect-to-a-database.md).  
  
### To delete a row in the database  
  
1.  Query the database for the row to be deleted.  
  
2.  Call the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601.DeleteOnSubmit%2A> method.  
  
3.  Submit the change to the database.  
  
## Example  
 This first code example queries the database for order details that belong to Order #11000, marks these order details for deletion, and submits these changes to the database.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Data.Linq.Table#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/system.data.linq.table/cs/program.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[System.Data.Linq.Table#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/system.data.linq.table/vb/module1.vb#3)]  
  
## Example  
 In this second example, the objective is to remove an order (#10250). The code first examines the `OrderDetails` table to see whether the order to be removed has children there. If the order has children, first the children and then the order are marked for removal. The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> puts the actual deletes in correct order so that delete commands sent to the database abide by the database constraints.
