# Numeric and Comparison Operators
Arithmetic and comparison operators work as expected in the common language runtime (CLR) except as follows:  
  
-   SQL does not support the modulus operator on floating-point numbers.  
  
-   SQL does not support unchecked arithmetic.  
  
-   Increment and decrement operators cause side-effects when you use them in expressions that cannot be replicated in SQL and are, therefore, not supported.  
  
## Supported Operators  
 [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] supports the following operators.  
  
-   Basic arithmetic operators:  
  
    -   `+`  
  
    -   `-` (subtraction)  
  
    -   `*`  
  
    -   `/`  
  
    -   Visual Basic integer division (`\`)  
  
    -   `%` (Visual Basic `Mod`)  
  
    -   `<<`  
  
    -   `>>`  
  
    -   `-` (unary negation)  
  
-   Basic comparison operators:  
  
    -   Visual Basic `=` and C# `==`  
  
    -   Visual Basic `<>` and C# `!=`  
  
    -   Visual Basic `Is/IsNot`  
  
    -   `<`  
  
    -   `<=`  
  
    -   `>`  
  
    -   `>=`
