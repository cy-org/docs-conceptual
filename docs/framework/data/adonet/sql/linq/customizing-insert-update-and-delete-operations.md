# Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations
By default, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] generates dynamic SQL to implement insert, read, update, and delete operations. In practice, however, you typically customize your application to suit your business needs.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to customize insert, update, and delete actions.
