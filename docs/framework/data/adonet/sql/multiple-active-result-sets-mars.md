# Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS)
Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) is a feature that allows the execution of multiple batches on a single connection. In previous versions, only one batch could be executed at a time against a single connection. Executing multiple batches with MARS does not imply simultaneous execution of operations.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Enabling Multiple Active Result Sets](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/enabling-multiple-active-result-sets.md)  
 Discusses how to use MARS with SQL Server.  
  
 [Manipulating Data](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/manipulating-data.md)  
 Provides examples of coding MARS applications.
