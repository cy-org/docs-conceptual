# Manipulating Data in a DataTable
After creating a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, you can perform the same activities that you would when using a table in a database. You can add, view, edit, and delete data in the table; you can monitor errors and events; and you can query the data in the table. When modifying data in a **DataTable**, you can also verify whether the changes are accurate, and determine whether to programmatically accept or reject the changes.
