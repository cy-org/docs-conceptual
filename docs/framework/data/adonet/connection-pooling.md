# Connection Pooling
Connecting to a data source can be time consuming. To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called *connection pooling*, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections. Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.  
  
## In This Section  
 [SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)  
 Provides an overview of connection pooling and describes how connection pooling works in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 [OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)  
 Describes connection pooling for the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle.
