# Querying DataSets (LINQ to DataSet)
After a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object has been populated with data, you can begin querying it. Formulating queries with [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)] is similar to using [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] against other [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)]-enabled data sources. Remember, however, that when you use [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries over a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object you are querying an enumeration of <xref:System.Data.DataRow> objects, instead of an enumeration of a custom type. This means that you can use any of the members of the <xref:System.Data.DataRow> class in your [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries. This lets you to create rich, complex queries.  
  
 As with other implementations of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)], you can create [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)] queries in two different forms: query expression syntax and method-based query syntax. For more information about these two forms, see [Getting Started with LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/6cc9af04-950a-4cc3-83d4-2aeb4abe4de9). You can use query expression syntax or method-based query syntax to perform queries against single tables in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, against multiple tables in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, or against tables in a typed <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.
