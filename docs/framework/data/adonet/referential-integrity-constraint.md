# referential integrity constraint
A *referential integrity constraint* in the Entity Data Model (EDM) is similar to a referential integrity constraint in a relational database. In the same way that a column (or columns) from a database table can reference the primary key of another table, a [property](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/property.md) (or properties) of an [entity type](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) can reference the [entity key](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-key.md) of another entity type. The entity type that is referenced is called the *principal end* of the constraint. The entity type that references the principal end is called the *dependent end* of the constraint.  
  
 A referential integrity constraint is defined as part of an [association](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md) between two entity types. The definition for a referential integrity constraint specifies the following information:  
  
-   The principal end of the constraint. (An entity type whose entity key is referenced by the dependent end.)  
  
-   The entity key of the principal end.  
  
-   The dependent end of the constraint. (An entity type that has a property or properties that reference the entity key of the principal end.)  
  
-   The referencing property or properties of the dependent end.  
  
 The purpose of referential integrity constraints in the EDM is to ensure that valid associations always exist. For more information, see [foreign key property](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/foreign-key-property.md).  
  
## Example  
 The diagram below shows a conceptual model with two associations: `WrittenBy` and `PublishedBy`. The `Book` entity type has a property, `PublisherId`, that references the entity key of the `Publisher` entity type when you define a referential integrity constraint on the `PublishedBy` association.  
  
 ![RefConstraintModel](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/media/refconstraintmodel.gif "RefConstraintModel")  
  
 The [ADO.NET Entity Framework](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/index.md) uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL defines a referential integrity constraint on the `PublishedBy` association shown in the conceptual model above.
