# Creating the Data Service
In this task, you will create a sample data service that uses [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] to expose an [!INCLUDE[ssODataFull](../../../../includes/ssodatafull-md.md)] feed that is based on the Northwind sample database. The task involves the following basic steps:  
  
1.  Create an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web application.  
  
2.  Define the data model by using the [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../includes/adonet-edm-md.md)] tools.  
  
3.  Add the data service to the Web application.  
  
4.  Enable access to the data service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web application that you create when you complete this task runs on the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Development Server provided by [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Development Server only supports access from the local computer. To also make it easier to test and troubleshoot the data service during development, consider running the application that hosts the data service by using Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information, see [How to: Develop a WCF Data Service Running on IIS](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/how-to-develop-a-wcf-data-service-running-on-iis.md).  
  
### To create the ASP.NET Web application  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], on the **File** menu, select **New**, and then select **Project**.  
  
2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, under either [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] select the **Web** template, and then select **ASP.NET Web Application**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you use [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] Web Developer, you must create a new Web site instead of a new Web application.  
  
3.  Type `NorthwindService` as the name of the project.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
5.  (Optional) Specify a specific port number for your Web application. Note: the port number `12345` is used in the rest of the quickstart.  
  
    1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the name of the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] project that you just created, and then click **Properties**.  
  
    2.  Select the **Web** tab, and set the value of the **Specific port** text box to `12345`.  
  
### To define the data model  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the name of the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] project, and then click **Add New Item.**  
  
2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, click the **Data** template and then select **ADO.NET Entity Data Model**.  
  
3.  For the name of the data model, type `Northwind.edmx`.  
  
4.  In the [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../includes/adonet-edm-md.md)] Wizard, select **Generate from Database**, and then click **Next**.  
  
5.  Connect the data model to the database by doing one of the following steps, and then click **Next**:  
  
    -   If you do not have a database connection already configured, click **New Connection** and create a new connection. For more information, see [How to: Create Connections to SQL Server Databases](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=123631). This [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance must have the Northwind sample database attached.  
  
         \- or -  
  
    -   If you have a database connection already configured to connect to the Northwind database, select that connection from the list of connections.  
  
6.  On the final page of the wizard, select the check boxes for all tables in the database, and clear the check boxes for views and stored procedures.  
  
7.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  This generated data model exposes foreign key properties on entity types. Data models created using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] 2008 do not include these foreign key properties. Because of this, you must update the client data service classes of any client applications that were created to access the Northwind data service that was created using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] 2008 before attempting to access this version of the Northwind data service.  
  
### To create the data service  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the name of your [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] project, and then click **Add New Item**.  
  
2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **WCF Data Service**.  
  
3.  For the name of the service, type `Northwind`.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)]Visual Studio creates the XML markup and code files for the new service. By default, the code-editor window opens. In **Solution Explorer**, the service will have the name, Northwind, with the extension .svc.cs or .svc.vb.  
  
4.  In the code for the data service, replace the comment `/* TODO: put your data source class name here */` in the definition of the class that defines the data service with the type that is the entity container of the data model, which in this case is `NorthwindEntities`. The class definition should look this the following:  
  
     [!code-csharp[Astoria Quickstart Service#ServiceDefinition](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria quickstart service/cs/northwind.svc.cs#servicedefinition)]
     [!code-vb[Astoria Quickstart Service#ServiceDefinition](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria quickstart service/vb/northwind.svc.vb#servicedefinition)]  
  
### To enable access to data service resources  
  
1.  In the code for the data service, replace the placeholder code in the `InitializeService` function with the following:  
  
     [!code-csharp[Astoria Quickstart Service#AllReadConfig](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria quickstart service/cs/northwind.svc.cs#allreadconfig)]
     [!code-vb[Astoria Quickstart Service#AllReadConfig](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria quickstart service/vb/northwind.svc.vb#allreadconfig)]  
  
     This enables authorized clients to have read and write access to resources for the specified entity sets.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Any client that can access the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application can also access the resources exposed by the data service. In a production data service, to prevent unauthorized access to resources you should also secure the application itself. For more information, see [Securing WCF Data Services](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/securing-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## Next Steps  
 You have successfully created a new data service that exposes an [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed that is based on the Northwind sample database, and you have enabled access to the feed for clients that have permissions on the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web application. Next, you will start the data service from [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] and you will access the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed by submitting HTTP GET requests through a Web browser:
