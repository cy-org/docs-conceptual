# How to: Add Query Options to a Data Service Query (WCF Data Services)
[!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] enables you to query a data service from a .NET Framework-based client application by using the generated client data service classes. The easiest to do this is to compose a Language Integrated Query (LINQ) query expression that includes the desired query options. You can also call a series of LINQ query methods to compose an equivalent query. Finally, you can use the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.AddQueryOption%2A> method to add query options to a query. In each of these cases, the URI that is generated by the client includes the requested entity set with the selected query options applied. For more information, see [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to compose a LINQ query expression that returns only orders with a freight cost of more than $30 and that orders the results by the ship date in descending order.

 [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#AddQueryOptionsLinq](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#addqueryoptionslinq)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to compose a LINQ query by using LINQ query methods that is equivalent to the previous query.

 [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#AddQueryOptionsLinqExpression](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#addqueryoptionslinqexpression)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to use to the  <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.AddQueryOption%2A> method to create a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> that is equivalent to the previous examples.

 [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#AddQueryOptions](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#addqueryoptions)]  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to use the `$orderby` query option to both filter and order returned Orders objects by the Freight property.
