# Quickstart (WCF Data Services)
This quickstart helps you become familiar with [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[ssODataFull](../../../../includes/ssodatafull-md.md)] through a series of tasks that support the topics in [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/getting-started-with-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## What You Will Learn  
 The first task in this quickstart shows how to create a data service to expose an [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed from the Northwind sample database. In later topics, you will access the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed by using a Web browser, and also create a [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] client application that consumes the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed by using client libraries.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To complete this quickstart, you must install the following components:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
-   An instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This includes SQL Server Express, which is included in a default installation of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)].  
  
-   The Northwind sample database. To download this sample database, see the download page, [Sample Databases for SQL Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=24758).  
  
## WCF Data Services Quickstart Tasks  
 [Creating the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-data-service.md)  
 Define the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application, define the data model, create the data service, and enable access to resources.  
  
 [Accessing the Service from a Web Browser](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/accessing-the-service-from-a-web-browser-wcf-data-services-quickstart.md)  
 Start the service from [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] and access the service by submitting HTTP GET requests through a Web browser to the exposed feed.  
  
 [Creating the .NET Framework Client Application](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-dotnet-client-application-wcf-data-services-quickstart.md)  
 Create a [!INCLUDE[avalon2](../../../../includes/avalon2-md.md)] client application to consume the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed, bind data to Windows controls, change data in the bound controls, and then send the changes back to the data service.
