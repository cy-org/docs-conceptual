# How to: Attach an Existing Entity to the DataServiceContext (WCF Data Services)
When an entity already exists in a data service, the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library enables you to attach an object that represents the entity directly to the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> without first executing a query. For more information, see [Updating the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/updating-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
 The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to create an existing `Customer` object that contains changes to be saved to the data service. The object is attached to the context and the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.UpdateObject%2A> method is called to mark the attached object as <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.EntityStates.Modified> before the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SaveChanges%2A> method is called.
