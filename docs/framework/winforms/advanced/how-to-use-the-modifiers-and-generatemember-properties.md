# How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties
When you place a component on a Windows Form, two properties are provided by the design environment: `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers`. The `GenerateMember` property specifies when the Windows Forms Designer generates a member variable for a component. The `Modifiers` property is the access modifier assigned to that member variable. If the value of the `GenerateMember` property is `false`, the value of the `Modifiers` property has no effect.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To specify whether a component is a member of the form  
  
1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, open your form.  
  
2.  Open the **Toolbox**, and on the form, place three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls.  
  
3.  Set the `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers` properties for each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control according to the following table.  
  
    |Button name|GenerateMember value|Modifiers value|  
    |-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|  
    |`button1`|`true`|`private`|  
    |`button2`|`true`|`protected`|  
    |`button3`|`false`|No change|  
  
4.  Build the solution.  
  
5.  In **Solution Explorer**, click the **Show All Files** button.  
  
6.  Open the **Form1** node, and in the **Code Editor**,open the **Form1.Designer.vb** or **Form1.Designer.cs** file. This file contains the code emitted by the Windows Forms Designer.  
  
7.  Find the declarations for the three buttons. The following code example shows the differences specified by the `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers` properties.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/CS/Form1.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/CS/Form1.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, the Windows Forms Designer assigns the `private` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) modifier to container controls like <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>. If your base <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> has a container control, it will not accept new children in inherited controls and forms. The solution is to change the modifier of the base container control to `protected` or `public`.
