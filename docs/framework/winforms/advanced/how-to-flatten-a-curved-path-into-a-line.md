# How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line
A <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object stores a sequence of lines and Bézier splines. You can add several types of curves (ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines) to a path, but each curve is converted to a Bézier spline before it is stored in the path. Flattening a path consists of converting each Bézier spline in the path to a sequence of straight lines. The following illustration shows a path before and after flattening.  
  
 ![Straight Lines and Curves](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif "AboutGdip02_Art32A")  
  
### To Flatten a Path  
  
-   call the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path.
