# How to: Create a Solid Brush
This example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.SolidBrush> object that can be used by a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object for filling shapes.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#1](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#1)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#1)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
 After you have finished using them, you should call <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> on objects that consume system resources, such as brush objects.
