# How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time
You can create a new setting at design time by using the Settings designer. The Settings designer is a grid-style interface that allows you to create new settings and specify properties for those settings. You must specify Name, Value, Type and Scope for your new settings. Once a setting is created, it is accessible in code.  
  
### To create a new setting at design time in C#  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Properties** node of your project.  
  
2.  Double-click the .settings file in which you want to add a new setting. The default name for this file is Settings.settings.  
  
3.  In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.  
  
### To create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your project node and choose **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** page, select the **Settings** tab.  
  
3.  In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.
