# How to: Draw an Outlined Shape
This example draws outlined ellipses and rectangles on a form.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#6](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#6)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#6)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#6)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 You cannot call this method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler. The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form. To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 You should always call <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> on any objects that consume system resources, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> and <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> objects.
