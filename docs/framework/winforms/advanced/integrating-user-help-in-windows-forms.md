# Integrating User Help in Windows Forms
An essential, but often overlooked, aspect of building Windows-based applications is the Help system, as this is where users turn for assistance in times of confusion. Windows Forms support two different types of Help, each provided by the [HelpProvider Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md). The first involves pointing the user to a Help file of either HTML or HTML Help 1.*x* or greater format. The second can display brief "What's This"-type Help on individual controls; this is especially useful on dialog boxes. Both types of Help can be used on the same form.  
  
 Additionally, the [ToolTip Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/tooltip-component-windows-forms.md) can be used to provide individual Help for controls on Windows Forms.
