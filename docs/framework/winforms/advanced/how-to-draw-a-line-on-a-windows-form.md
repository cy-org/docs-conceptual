# How to: Draw a Line on a Windows Form
This example draws a line on a form. Typically, when you draw on a form, you handle the formâ€™s  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event and perform the drawing using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, as shown in this example  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#11)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 You should always call <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> on any objects that consume system resources, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> objects.
