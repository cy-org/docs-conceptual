# Using Double Buffering
You can use double-buffered graphics to reduce flicker in your applications that contain complex painting operations. The .NET Framework contains built-in support for double-buffering or you can manage and render graphics manually.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Double Buffered Graphics](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/double-buffered-graphics.md)  
 Introduces double buffering concept and outlines .NET Framework support.  
  
 [How to: Reduce Graphics Flicker with Double Buffering for Forms and Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-reduce-graphics-flicker-with-double-buffering-for-forms-and-controls.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the default double buffering support in the .NET Framework.  
  
 [How to: Manually Manage Buffered Graphics](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-manually-manage-buffered-graphics.md)  
 Shows how to manage double buffering in applications.  
  
 [How to: Manually Render Buffered Graphics](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-manually-render-buffered-graphics.md)  
 Demonstrates how to render double-buffered graphics.
