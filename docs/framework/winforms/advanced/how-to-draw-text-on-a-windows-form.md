# How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form
The following code example shows how to use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> to draw text on a form. Alternatively, you can use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> for drawing text on a form. For more information, see [How to: Draw Text with GDI](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#7)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#7)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#7)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 You cannot call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler. The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form. To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   The Arial font is not installed.
