# Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time
This walkthrough shows you how to change property values of a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control hosted on a Windows Form.  
  
 In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:  
  
-   Create the project.  
  
-   Create the WPF control.  
  
-   Host the WPF controls on a Windows Form.  
  
-   Use the WPF Designer for Visual Studio to change property values.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  
  
## Creating the Project  
 The first step is to create the Windows Forms project.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.  
  
#### To create the project  
  
-   Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `WpfHost`.  
  
## Creating the WPF Control  
 After you add a WPF control to the project, you can arrange it on the form.  
  
#### To create WPF controls  
  
1.  Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> to the project. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property to `Blue`.  
  
3.  Build the project.  
  
## Changing Property Values on the WPF Control  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> smart tag makes it easy to change properties of hosted WPF content by using the WPF Designer.  
  
#### To host a WPF control  
  
1.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  
  
2.  In the **Toolbox**, in the **WPF User Controls** tab, double-click `UserControl1` to create an instance of `UserControl1` on the form.  
  
     The instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.  
  
3.  In the **ElementHost Tasks** smart tag panel, select **Edit Hosted Content**.  
  
     UserControl1.xaml opens in the WPF Designer.  
  
4.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property to `Red`.  
  
5.  Rebuild the project.  
  
6.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  
  
     The instance of `UserControl1` has a red background.
