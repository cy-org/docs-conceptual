# How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms
Frequently, you will want to print graphics in your Windows-based application. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing objects to a device, such as a screen or printer.  
  
### To print graphics  
  
1.  Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form.  
  
2.  In the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler, use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> class to instruct the printer on what kind of graphics to print.  
  
     The following code example shows an event handler used to create a blue ellipse within a bounding rectangle. The rectangle has the following location and dimensions: beginning at 100, 150 with a width of 250 and a height of 250.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage  
       e.Graphics.FillEllipse(Brushes.Blue, New Rectangle(100, 150, 250, 250))  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void printDocument1_PrintPage(object sender,   
    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs e)  
    {  
       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Blue,   
         new Rectangle(100, 150, 250, 250));  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:  
       void printDocument1_PrintPage(System::Object ^ sender,  
          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventArgs ^ e)  
       {  
          e->Graphics->FillRectangle(Brushes::Blue,  
             Rectangle(100, 150, 250, 250));  
       }  
    ```  
  
     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  
  
    ```csharp  
    this.printDocument1.PrintPage += new  
       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventHandler  
       (this.printDocument1_PrintPage);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    this->printDocument1->PrintPage += gcnew  
       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventHandler  
       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_PrintPage);  
    ```
