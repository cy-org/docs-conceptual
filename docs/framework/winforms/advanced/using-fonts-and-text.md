# Using Fonts and Text
There are several classes offered by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] for drawing text on Windows Forms. The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class has several <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> methods that allow you to specify various features of text, such as location, bounding rectangle, font, and format. In addition, you can draw and measure text with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] using the static <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.MeasureText%2A> methods offered by the `TextRenderer` class. The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] methods also allow you to specify location, font, and format. You can choose either [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] for text rendering; however, [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] generally offers better performance and more accurate text measuring. Other classes that contribute to text rendering include `FontFamily`, `Font`, <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat>, and `TextFormatFlags`.
