# How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region
The purpose of hit testing is to determine whether the cursor is over a given object, such as an icon or a button.  
  
## Example  
 The following example creates a plus-shaped region by forming the union of two rectangular regions. Assume that the variable `point` holds the location of the most recent click. The code checks to see whether `point` is in the plus-shaped region. If the point is in the region (a hit), the region is filled with an opaque red brush. Otherwise, the region is filled with a semitransparent red brush.

## Compiling the Code  
 The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.
