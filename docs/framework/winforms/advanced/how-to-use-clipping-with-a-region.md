# How to: Use Clipping with a Region
One of the properties of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class is the clip region. All drawing done by a given <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object is restricted to the clip region of that <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. You can set the clip region by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method.  
  
## Example  
 The following example constructs a path that consists of a single polygon. Then the code constructs a region, based on that path. The region is passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, and then two strings are drawn.  
  
 The following illustration shows the clipped strings.

 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#41](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.
