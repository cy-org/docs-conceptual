# How to: Fill Open Figures
You can fill a path by passing a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method fills the path according to the fill mode (alternate or winding) currently set for the path. If the path has any open figures, the path is filled as if those figures were closed. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] closes a figure by drawing a straight line from its ending point to its starting point.  
  
## Example  
 The following example creates a path that has one open figure (an arc) and one closed figure (an ellipse). The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method fills the path according to the default fill mode, which is <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.FillMode.Alternate>.  
  
 The following illustration shows the output of the example code. Note that the path is filled (according to <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.FillMode.Alternate>) as if the open figure were closed by a straight line from its ending point to its starting point.

 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.
