# How to: Print a Windows Form
As part of the development process, you typically will want to print a copy of your Windows Form. The following code example shows how to print a copy of the current form by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This is a complete code example that contains a `Main` method.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   You do not have permission to access the printer.  
  
-   There is no printer installed.  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 In order to run this code example, you must have permission to access the printer you use with your computer.
