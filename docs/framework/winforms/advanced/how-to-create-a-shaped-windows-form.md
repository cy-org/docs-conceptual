# How to: Create a Shaped Windows Form
This example gives a form an elliptical shape that resizes with the form.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#10](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#10)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#10)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#10)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms> and <xref:System.Drawing> namespaces.  
  
 This example overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method to change the shape of the form. To use this code, copy the method declaration as well as the drawing code inside the method.
