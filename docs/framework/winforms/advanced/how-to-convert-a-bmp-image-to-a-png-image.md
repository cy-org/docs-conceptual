# How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image
Oftentimes, you will want to convert from one image file format to another. You can do this conversion easily by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.Save%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class and specifying the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat> for the desired image file format.  
  
## Example  
 The following example loads a BMP image from a type, and saves the image in the PNG format.  
  
 [!code-csharp[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/CS/Form1.cs#4)]
 [!code-vb[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/VB/Form1.vb#4)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   A Windows Forms application.  
  
-   A reference to the `System.Drawing.Imaging` namespace.
