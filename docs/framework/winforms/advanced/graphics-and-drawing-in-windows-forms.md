# Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms
The common language runtime uses an advanced implementation of the Windows Graphics Device Interface ([!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)]) called [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]. With [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] you can create graphics, draw text, and manipulate graphical images as objects. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is designed to offer performance and ease of use. You can use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] to render graphical images on Windows Forms and controls. Although you cannot use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] directly on Web Forms, you can display graphical images through the Image Web Server control.  
  
 In this section, you will find topics that introduce the fundamentals of [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] programming. Although not intended to be a comprehensive reference, this section includes information about the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, <xref:System.Drawing.Pen>, <xref:System.Drawing.Brush>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Color> objects, and explains how to perform such tasks as drawing shapes, drawing text, or displaying images. For more information, see "GDI+ Reference" in the MSDN library at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library.  
  
 If you'd like to jump in and get started right away, see [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md). It has topics on how to use code to draw lines, shapes, text, and more on Windows forms.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Graphics Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/graphics-overview-windows-forms.md)  
 Provides an introduction to the graphics-related managed classes.  
  
 [About GDI+ Managed Code](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/about-gdi-managed-code.md)  
 Provides information about the managed [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes.  
  
 [Using Managed Graphics Classes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-managed-graphics-classes.md)  
 Demonstrates how to complete a variety of tasks using the [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] managed classes.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:System.Drawing>  
 Provides access to [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] basic graphics functionality.  
  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D>  
 Provides advanced two-dimensional and vector graphics functionality.  
  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging>  
 Provides advanced [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] imaging functionality.  
  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Text>  
 Provides advanced [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] typography functionality. The classes in this namespace can be used to create and use collections of fonts.  
  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Printing>  
 Provides printing functionality.
