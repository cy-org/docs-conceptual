# How to: Set the Color of a Pen
This example changes the color of a pre-existing <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#9](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#9)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#9)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#9)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   A <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object named `myPen`.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 You should call <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.Dispose%2A> on objects that consume system resources (such as <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> objects) after you are finished using them.
