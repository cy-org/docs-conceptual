# Constructing and Drawing Paths
A path is a sequence of graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, curves, text, and the like) that can be manipulated and drawn as a single unit. A path can be divided into *figures* that are either open or closed. A figure can contain several primitives.  
  
 You can draw a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)  
 Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> to create figures.  
  
 [How to: Fill Open Figures](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-fill-open-figures.md)  
 Explains how to fill a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>.  
  
 [How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)  
 Shows how to flatten a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>  
 Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.
