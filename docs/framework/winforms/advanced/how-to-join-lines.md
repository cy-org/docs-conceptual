# How to: Join Lines
A line join is the common area that is formed by two lines whose ends meet or overlap. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] provides three line join styles: miter, bevel, and round. Line join style is a property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class. When you specify a line join style for a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object, that join style will be applied to all the connected lines in any <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object drawn using that pen.  
  
 The following illustration shows the results of the beveled line join example.  
  
 ![Pens](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/pens5.gif "pens5")  
  
## Example  
 You can specify the line join style by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class. The example demonstrates a beveled line join between a horizontal line and a vertical line. In the following code, the value <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin.Bevel> assigned to the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration. The other members of the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration are <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin.Miter> and <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin.Round>.

## Compiling the Code  
 The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.
