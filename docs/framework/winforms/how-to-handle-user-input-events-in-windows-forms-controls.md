# How to: Handle User Input Events in Windows Forms Controls
This example demonstrates how to handle most keyboard, mouse, focus, and validation events that can occur in a Windows Forms control. The text box named `TextBoxInput` receives the events when it has focus, and information about each event is written in the text box named `TextBoxOutput` in the order in which the events are raised. The application also includes a set of check boxes that can be used to filter which events to report.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.UserInputWalkthrough#0](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.UserInputWalkthrough/cpp/form1.cpp#0)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.UserInputWalkthrough#0](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.UserInputWalkthrough/CS/form1.cs#0)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.UserInputWalkthrough#0](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.UserInputWalkthrough/VB/form1.vb#0)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
