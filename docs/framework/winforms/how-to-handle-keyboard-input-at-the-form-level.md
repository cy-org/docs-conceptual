# How to: Handle Keyboard Input at the Form Level
Windows Forms provides the ability to handle keyboard messages at the form level, before the messages reach a control. This topic shows how to accomplish this task.  
  
### To handle a keyboard message at the form level  
  
-   Handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event of the startup form, and set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.KeyPreview%2A> property of the form to `true` so that keyboard messages are received by the form before they reach any controls on the form. The following code example handles the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event by detecting all of the number keys and consuming '1', '4', and '7'.  
  
     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInputForm#10](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInputForm/cpp/form1.cpp#10)]
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInputForm#10](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInputForm/CS/form1.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInputForm#10](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.KeyboardInputForm/VB/form1.vb#10)]  
  
## Example  
 The following code example is the entire application for the above example. The application includes a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> along with several other controls that allow you to move focus from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event of the main <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> consumes '1', '4', and '7', and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> consumes '2', '5', and '8' while displaying the remaining keys. Compare the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> output when you press a number key while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> has focus with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> output when you press a number key while focus is on one of the other controls.

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
