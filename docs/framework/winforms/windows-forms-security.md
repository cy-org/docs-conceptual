# Windows Forms Security
Windows Forms features a security model that is code-based (security levels are set for code, regardless of the user running the code). This is in addition to any security schemas that may be in place already on your computer system. These can include those in the browser (such as the zone-based security available in Internet Explorer) or the operating system (such as the credential-based security of Windows NT).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Security in Windows Forms Overview](../../../docs/framework/winforms/security-in-windows-forms-overview.md)  
 Briefly explains the .NET Framework security model and the basic steps necessary to ensure the Windows Forms in your application are secure.  
  
 [More Secure File and Data Access in Windows Forms](../../../docs/framework/winforms/more-secure-file-and-data-access-in-windows-forms.md)  
 Describes how to access files and data in a semi-trusted environment.  
  
 [More Secure Printing in Windows Forms](../../../docs/framework/winforms/more-secure-printing-in-windows-forms.md)  
 Describes how to access printing features in a semi-trusted environment.  
  
 [Additional Security Considerations in Windows Forms](../../../docs/framework/winforms/additional-security-considerations-in-windows-forms.md)  
 Describes performing window manipulation, using the Clipboard, and making calls to unmanaged code in a semi-trusted environment.
