# How to: Resize Windows Forms
You can specify the size of your Windows Form in several ways. You can change both the height and the width of the form programmatically by setting a new value for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property, or adjust the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Height%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Width%2A> properties individually. If you are using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], you can change the size using the Windows Forms Designer. Also see [How to: Resize Windows Forms Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/37k2zkwx\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
### To resize a form programmatically  
  
-   Define the size of a form at run time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property of the form.  
  
     The following code example shows the form size set to 100 Ã— 100 pixels.  
  
    ```vb  
    Form1.Size = New System.Drawing.Size(100, 100)  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    Form1.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(100, 100);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    Form1->Size = System::Drawing::Size(100, 100);  
    ```  
  
### To change form width and height programmatically  
  
-   After the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> is defined, change either the form height or width by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Height%2A> properties.  
  
     The following code example shows the width of the form set to 300 pixels from the left edge of the form, whereas the height stays constant.  
  
    ```vb  
    Form1.Width = 300  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    Form1.Width = 300;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    Form1->Width = 300;  
    ```  
  
     -or-  
  
     Change <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Height%2A> by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property.  
  
     However, as the following code example shows, this approach is more cumbersome than just setting <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Height%2A> properties.  
  
    ```vb  
    Form1.Size = New Size(300, Form1.Size.Height)  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    Form1.Size = new Size(300, Form1.Size.Height);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    Form1->Size = System::Drawing::Size(300, Form1->Size.Height);  
    ```  
  
### To change form size by increments programmatically  
  
-   To increment the size of the form, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Height%2A> properties.  
  
     The following code example shows the width of the form set to 200 pixels wider than the current setting.  
  
    ```vb  
    Form1.Width += 200  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    Form1.Width += 200;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    Form1->Width += 200;  
    ```  
  
    > [!CAUTION]
    >  Always use the <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Height%2A> or <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Width%2A> property to change a dimension of a form, unless you are setting both height and width dimensions at the same time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property to a new <xref:System.Drawing.Size> structure. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property returns a <xref:System.Drawing.Size> structure, which is a value type. You cannot assign a new value to the property of a value type. Therefore, the following code example will not compile.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' NOTE: CODE WILL NOT COMPILE  
    Dim f As New Form()  
    f.Size.Width += 100  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // NOTE: CODE WILL NOT COMPILE  
    Form f = new Form();  
    f.Size.Width += 100;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    // NOTE: CODE WILL NOT COMPILE  
    Form^ f = gcnew Form();  
    f->Size->X += 100;  
    ```
