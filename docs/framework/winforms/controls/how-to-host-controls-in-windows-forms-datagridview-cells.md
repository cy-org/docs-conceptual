# How to: Host Controls in Windows Forms DataGridView Cells
The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control provides several column types, enabling your users to enter and edit values in a variety of ways. If these column types do not meet your data-entry needs, however, you can create your own column types with cells that host controls of your choosing. To do this, you must define classes that derive from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell>. You must also define a class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> and implements the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IDataGridViewEditingControl> interface.  
  
 The following code example shows how to create a calendar column. The cells of this column display dates in ordinary text box cells, but when the user edits a cell, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control appears. In order to avoid having to implement text box display functionality again, the `CalendarCell` class derives from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxCell> class rather than inheriting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> class directly.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you derive from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> and add new properties to the derived class, be sure to override the `Clone` method to copy the new properties during cloning operations. You should also call the base class's `Clone` method so that the properties of the base class are copied to the new cell or column.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCalendarColumn#000](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCalendarColumn/CS/datagridviewcalendarcolumn.cs#000)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCalendarColumn#000](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCalendarColumn/VB/datagridviewcalendarcolumn.vb#000)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 The following example requires:  
  
-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
