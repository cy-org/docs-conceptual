# How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms
To position controls, use the Windows Forms Designer, or specify the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To position a control on the design surface of the Windows Forms Designer  
  
-   Drag the control to the appropriate location with the mouse.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Select the control and move it with the ARROW keys to position it more precisely. Also, *snaplines* assist you in placing controls precisely on your form. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md).  
  
### To position a control using the Properties window  
  
1.  Click the control you want to position.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, type values for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property, separated by a comma, to position the control within its container.  
  
     The first number (X) is the distance from the left border of the container; the second number (Y) is the distance from the upper border of the container area, measured in pixels.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can expand the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property to type the **X** and **Y** values individually.  
  
### To position a control programmatically  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property of the control to a <xref:System.Drawing.Point>.  
  
    ```vb  
    Button1.Location = New Point(100, 100)  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    button1.Location = new Point(100, 100);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    button1->Location = Point(100, 100);  
    ```  
  
2.  Change the X coordinate of the control's location using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> subproperty.  
  
    ```vb  
    Button1.Left = 300  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    button1.Left = 300;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    button1->Left = 300;  
    ```  
  
### To increment a control's location programmatically  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> subproperty to increment the X coordinate of the control.  
  
    ```vb  
    Button1.Left += 200  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    button1.Left += 200;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    button1->Left += 200;  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property to set a control's X and Y positions simultaneously. To set a position individually, use the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> (**X**) or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Top%2A> (**Y**) subproperty. Do not try to implicitly set the X and Y coordinates of the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure that represents the button's location, because this structure contains a copy of the button's coordinates.
