# How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms
You can make your control align to the edge of your forms by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property. This property designates where your control resides in the form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property can be set to the following values:  
  
|Setting|Effect on your control|  
|-------------|----------------------------|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Bottom>|Docks to the bottom of the form.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill>|Fills all remaining space in the form.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Left>|Docks to the left side of the form.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.None>|Does not dock anywhere, and it appears at the location specified by its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Right>|Docks to the right side of the form.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Top>|Docks to the top of the form.|  
  
 There is design-time support for this feature in Visual Studio.  
  
### To set the Dock property for your control at run time  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to the appropriate value in code.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' To set the Dock property internally.  
    Me.Dock = DockStyle.Top  
    ' To set the Dock property from another object.  
    UserControl1.Dock = DockStyle.Top  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // To set the Dock property internally.  
    this.Dock = DockStyle.Top;  
    // To set the Dock property from another object.  
    UserControl1.Dock = DockStyle.Top;  
    ```
