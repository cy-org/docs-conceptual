# How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control
Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to group other controls. There are three reasons to group controls:  
  
-   To create a visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface.  
  
-   To create programmatic grouping (of radio buttons, for example).  
  
-   For moving the controls as a unit at design time.  
  
### To create a group of controls  
  
1.  Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control on a form.  
  
2.  Add other controls to the group box, drawing each inside the group box.  
  
     If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, and then paste them into the group box. You can also drag them into the group box.  
  
3.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property of the group box to an appropriate caption.
