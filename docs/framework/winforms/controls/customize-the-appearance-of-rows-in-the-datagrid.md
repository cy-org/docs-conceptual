# How to: Customize the Appearance of Rows in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control
You can control the appearance of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> rows by handling one or both of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPostPaint?displayProperty=fullName> events. These events are designed so that you can paint only what you want to while letting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control paint the rest. For example, if you want to paint a custom background, you can handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint?displayProperty=fullName> event and let the individual cells paint their own foreground content. Alternately, you can let the cells paint themselves and add custom foreground content in a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPostPaint?displayProperty=fullName> event. You can also disable cell painting and paint everything yourself in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint?displayProperty=fullName> event handler.  
  
 The following code example implements handlers for both events in order to provide a gradient selection background and some custom foreground content that spans multiple columns.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPainting#00](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPainting/CS/datagridviewrowpainting.cs#00)]
