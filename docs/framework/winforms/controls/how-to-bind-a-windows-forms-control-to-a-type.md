# How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type
When you are building controls that interact with data, you will sometimes find it necessary to bind a control to a type, rather than an object. This situation arises especially at design time, when data may not be available, but your data-bound controls still need to display information from a type's public interface. For example, you may bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to an object exposed by a Web service and want the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to label its columns at design time with the member names of a custom type.  
  
 You can easily bind a control to a type with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to a custom type by using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. When you run the example, you'll notice the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> has labeled columns that reflect the properties of a `Customer` object, before the control is populated with data. The example has an Add Customer button to add data to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. When you click the button, a new `Customer` object is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>. In a real-world scenario, the data might be obtained by a call to a Web service or other data source.
