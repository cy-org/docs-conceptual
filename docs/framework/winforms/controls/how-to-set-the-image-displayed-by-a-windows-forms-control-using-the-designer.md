# How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer
Several Windows Forms controls can display images. The image can be an icon that clarifies the purpose of the control, such as a disk icon on a button denoting the **Save** command. Alternatively, the icon can be a background image to give the control the appearance you want.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To set the image displayed by a control  
  
1.  In the **Properties** window, select the **Image** or **BackgroundImage** property of the control, then click the ellipsis button (  
  
     ![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")  
  
     ) to display the **Select Resource** dialog box.  
  
2.  Select the image you want to display.
