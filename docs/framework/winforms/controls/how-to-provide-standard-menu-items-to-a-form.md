# How to: Provide Standard Menu Items to a Form
You can provide a standard menu for your forms with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> control.  
  
 There is extensive support for this feature in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 Also see [Walkthrough: Providing Standard Menu Items to a Form](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233662\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> control to create a form with a standard menu. Menu item selections are displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> control.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
