# Multithreading in Windows Forms Controls
In many applications, you can make your user interface (UI) more responsive by performing time-consuming operations on another thread. A number of tools are available for multithreading your Windows Forms controls, including the <xref:System.Threading> namespace, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, and the `BackgroundWorker` component.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `BackgroundWorker` component replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Threading> namespace and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method; however, these are retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose. For more information, see [BackgroundWorker Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/backgroundworker-component-overview.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Make Thread-Safe Calls to Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-make-thread-safe-calls-to-windows-forms-controls.md)  
 Shows how to make thread-safe calls to Windows Forms controls.  
  
 [How to: Use a Background Thread to Search for Files](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-use-a-background-thread-to-search-for-files.md)  
 Shows how to use the <xref:System.Threading> namespace and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A> method to search for files asynchronously.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker>  
 Documents a component that encapsulates a worker thread for asynchronous operations.  
  
 <xref:System.Media.SoundPlayer.LoadAsync%2A>  
 Documents how to load a sound asynchronously.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync%2A>
