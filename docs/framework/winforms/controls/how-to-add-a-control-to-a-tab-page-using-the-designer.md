# How to: Add a Control to a Tab Page Using the Designer
The use of the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> is to display other controls in an organized fashion. You can use these instructions to display a picture on the main part of a tab page. For information about adding an icon to the label part of a tab page, see [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms TabControl](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-tabcontrol.md).  
  
 The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).
