# How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer
Windows Forms controls typically display some text that is related to the primary function of the control. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control typically displays a caption that indicates what action will be performed when the button is clicked. For all controls, you can set or return the text by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property. You can change the font by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property.  
  
### To set the text and font with the designer  
  
1.  In the Properties window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of the control to an appropriate string.  
  
     To create an underlined shortcut key, includes an ampersand (&) before the letter that will be the shortcut key.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property.  
  
     In the standard font dialog box, select the font, font style, size, effects (such as strikeout or underline), and script that you want.
