# How to: Raise Change Notifications Using a BindingSource and the INotifyPropertyChanged Interface
The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component will automatically detect changes in a data source when the type contained in the data source implements the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> interface and raises <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged> events when a property value is changed. This is useful because controls bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> will then automatically update as the data source values change.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If your data source implements <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> and you are performing asynchronous operations, you should not make changes to the data source on a background thread. Instead, you should read the data on a background thread and merge the data into a list on the UI thread.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates a simple implementation of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> interface. It also shows how the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> automatically passes a data source change to a bound control when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is bound to a list of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> type.  
  
 If you use the `CallerMemberName` attribute, calls to the `NotifyPropertyChanged` method don't have to specify the property name as a string argument. For more information, see [Caller Information](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9cb2b8c0-c4f6-44b8-9c90-38948455b373).

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
