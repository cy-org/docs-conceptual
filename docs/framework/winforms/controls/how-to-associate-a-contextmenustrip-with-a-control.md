# How to: Associate a ContextMenuStrip with a Control
After creating your controls and shortcut menus, use the following procedures to display a given shortcut menu when the user right-clicks the control. These procedures associate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> with a Windows Form and with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control.  
  
### To associate a ContextMenuStrip with a Windows Form  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ContextMenuStrip%2A> property to the name of the associated <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip>.  
  
### To associate a ContextMenuStrip with a ToolStrip control  
  
1.  Set the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ContextMenuStrip%2A> property to the name of the associated <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip>.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example creates a Windows Form and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip>, and associates a different <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> control with each of them.
