# How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box (Windows Forms)
You can transform an editable Windows Forms text box into a read-only control. For example, the text box may display a value that is usually edited but may not be currently, due to the state of the application.  
  
### To create a read-only text box  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A> property to `true`. With the property set to `true`, users can still scroll and highlight text in a text box without allowing changes. A **Copy** command is functional in a text box, but **Cut** and **Paste** commands are not.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A> property only affects user interaction at run time. You can still change text box contents programmatically at run time by changing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of the text box.
