# How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String (Windows Forms)
Sometimes you might want to place quotation marks (" ") in a string of text. For example:  
  
 She said, "You deserve a treat!"  
  
 As an alternative, you can also use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ControlChars.Quote> field as a constant.  
  
### To place quotation marks in a string in your code  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], insert two quotation marks in a row as an embedded quotation mark. In [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)], insert the escape sequence \\" as an embedded quotation mark. For example, to create the preceding string, use the following code.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub InsertQuote()  
       TextBox1.Text = "She said, ""You deserve a treat!"" "  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void InsertQuote(){  
       textBox1.Text = "She said, \"You deserve a treat!\" ";  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:  
       void InsertQuote()  
       {  
          textBox1->Text = "She said, \"You deserve a treat!\" ";  
       }  
    ```  
  
     -or-  
  
2.  Insert the ASCII or Unicode character for a quotation mark. In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], use the ASCII character (34). In [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], use the Unicode character (\u0022).  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub InsertAscii()  
       TextBox1.Text = "She said, " & Chr(34) & "You deserve a treat!" & Chr(34)  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void InsertAscii(){  
       textBox1.Text = "She said, " + '\u0022' + "You deserve a treat!" + '\u0022';  
    }  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In this example, you cannot use \u0022 because you cannot use a universal character name that designates a character in the basic character set. Otherwise, you produce C3851. For more information, see [Compiler Error C3851](/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-2/compiler-error-c3851).  
  
     -or-  
  
3.  You can also define a constant for the character, and use it where needed.  
  
    ```vb  
    Const quote As String = """"  
    TextBox1.Text = "She said, " & quote & "You deserve a treat!" & quote  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    const string quote = "\"";  
    textBox1.Text = "She said, " + quote +  "You deserve a treat!"+ quote ;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    const String^ quote = "\"";  
    textBox1->Text = String::Concat("She said, ",  
       const_cast<String^>(quote), "You deserve a treat!",  
       const_cast<String^>(quote));  
    ```
