# How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Factory Object
When you are building controls that interact with data, you will sometimes find it necessary to bind a control to an object or method that generates other objects. Such an object or method is called a factory. Your data source might be, for example, the return value from a method call, instead of an object in memory or a type. You can bind a control to this kind of data source as long as the source returns a collection.  
  
 You can easily bind a control to a factory object by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control.  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to a factory method by using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control. The factory method is named `GetOrdersByCustomerId`, and it returns all the orders for a given customer in the Northwind database.

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
