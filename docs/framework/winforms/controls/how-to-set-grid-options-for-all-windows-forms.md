# How to: Set Grid Options for All Windows Forms
As you become used to working in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] development environment, you can set preferences for all the forms and projects you work with in the Windows Forms Designer.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To set global Windows Forms options  
  
1.  From the **Tools** menu, select **Options**.  
  
2.  In the left pane of the **Options** dialog box, click **Windows Forms Designer**.  
  
     In the right pane, under the **Layout Settings** heading, you can set the default grid settings for all the new forms you create. These settings include the grid size, whether controls snap to it, and whether it is on by default. In addition, you can select between **SnapToGrid** and **SnapLines** layout modes. For more information on snaplines, see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md).
