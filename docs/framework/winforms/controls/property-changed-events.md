# Property-Changed Events
If you want your control to send notifications when a property named *PropertyName* changes, define an event named *PropertyName*`Changed` and a method named `On`*PropertyName*`Changed` that raises the event. The naming convention in Windows Forms is to append the word *Changed* to the name of the property. The associated event delegate type for property-changed events is <xref:System.EventHandler>, and the event data type is <xref:System.EventArgs>. The base class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> defines many property-changed events, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColorChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImageChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.FontChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LocationChanged>, and others. For background information about events, see [Events](../../../../docs/standard/events/index.md) and [Events in Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/events-in-windows-forms-controls.md).  
  
 Property-changed events are useful because they allow consumers of a control to attach event handlers that respond to the change. If your control needs to respond to a property-changed event that it raises, override the corresponding `On`*PropertyName*`Changed` method instead of attaching a delegate to the event. A control typically responds to a property-changed event by updating other properties or by redrawing some or all of its drawing surface.  
  
 The following example shows how the `FlashTrackBar` custom control responds to some of the property-changed events that it inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>. For the complete sample, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).
