# How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls
The <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=fullName> namespace supports multiple document interface (MDI) applications, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> control supports menu merging. MDI forms can also <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls.  
  
 There is extensive support for this feature in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 Also see [Walkthrough: Creating an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233676\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> controls with an MDI form. The form also supports menu merging with child menus.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This code example requires:  
  
-   References to the System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
