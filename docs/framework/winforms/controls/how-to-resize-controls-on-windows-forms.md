# How to: Resize Controls on Windows Forms
You can resize individual controls, and you can resize multiple controls of the same or different kind, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls.  
  
### To resize a control  
  
1.  Click the control to be resized and drag one of the eight sizing handles.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Select the control and press the ARROW keys while holding down the SHIFT key to resize the control one pixel at a time. Press the DOWN or RIGHT arrow keys while holding down the SHIFT and CTRL keys to resize the control in large increments.  
  
### To resize multiple controls on a form  
  
1.  Hold down the CTRL or SHIFT key and select the controls you want to resize. The size of the first control you select is used for the other controls.  
  
2.  On the **Format** menu, choose **Make Same Size**, and select one of the four options. The first three commands change the dimensions of the controls to match the first-selected control.
