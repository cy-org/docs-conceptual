# How to: Group Items in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer
The grouping feature of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control enables you to display related sets of items in groups. These groups are separated on the screen by horizontal group headers that contain the group titles. You can use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> groups to make navigating large lists easier by grouping items alphabetically, by date, or by any other logical grouping. The following image shows some grouped items.  
  
 ![ListView Groups](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/media/listviewgroups.gif "ListViewGroups")  
  
 The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  
  
 To enable grouping, you must first create one or more <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup> objects either in the designer or programmatically. Once a group has been defined, you can assign items to it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> groups are available only on [!INCLUDE[WinXpFamily](../../../../includes/winxpfamily-md.md)] when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. On earlier operating systems, any code relating to groups has no effect and the groups will not appear. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  
>   
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To add or remove groups in the designer  
  
1.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Groups%2A> property.  
  
     The **ListViewGroup Collection Editor** appears.  
  
2.  To add a group, click the **Add** button. You can then set properties of the new group, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.Header%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewGroup.HeaderAlignment%2A> properties. To remove a group, select it and click the **Remove** button.  
  
### To assign items to groups in the designer  
  
1.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> property.  
  
     The **ListViewItem Collection Editor** appears.  
  
2.  To add a new item, click the **Add** button. You can then set properties of the new item, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.Text%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.ImageIndex%2A> properties.  
  
3.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.Group%2A> property and choose a group from the drop-down list.
