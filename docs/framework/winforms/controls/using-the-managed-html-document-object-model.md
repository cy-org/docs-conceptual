# Using the Managed HTML Document Object Model
The managed HTML document object model (DOM) provides a wrapper based on the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] for the HTML classes exposed by Internet Explorer. Use these classes to manipulate HTML pages hosted in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser> control, or to build new pages from the beginning.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How to: Access the Managed HTML Document Object Model](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-access-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  
 Describes how to obtain a valid instance of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlDocument> from either a Windows Forms application or a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl> hosted in Internet Explorer.  
  
 [How to: Access the HTML Source in the Managed HTML Document Object Model](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-access-the-html-source-in-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  
 Describes how to obtain the original, unmodified HTML source, and how to obtain the "live" source that reflects the current state of the DOM.  
  
 [How to: Change Styles on an Element in the Managed HTML Document Object Model](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-styles-on-an-element-in-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  
 Describes how to manipulate styles, which are used to control the visual display of elements.  
  
 [Accessing Frames in the Managed HTML Document Object Model](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/accessing-frames-in-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  
 Describes what frames and framesets are, and how to access the DOM of a frame.  
  
 [Accessing Unexposed Members on the Managed HTML Document Object Model](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/accessing-unexposed-members-on-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  
 Describes how to access members of the underlying DOM that do not have a managed equivalent.
