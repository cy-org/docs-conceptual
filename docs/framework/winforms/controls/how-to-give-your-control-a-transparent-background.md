# How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background
In earlier versions of the .NET Framework, controls didn't support setting transparent backcolors without first setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.SetStyle%2A> method in the forms's constructor. In the current framework version, the backcolor for most controls can be set to <xref:System.Drawing.Color.Transparent%2A> in the **Properties** window at design time, or in code in the form's constructor.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Windows Forms controls do not support true transparency. The background of a transparent Windows Forms control is painted by its parent.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control doesn't support a transparent backcolor even when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.BackColor%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Drawing.Color.Transparent%2A>.  
  
### To give your control a transparent backcolor  
  
-   In the Properties window, choose the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.BackColor%2A> property and set it to <xref:System.Drawing.Color.Transparent%2A>
