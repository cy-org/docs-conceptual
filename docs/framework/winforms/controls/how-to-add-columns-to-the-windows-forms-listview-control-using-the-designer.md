# How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control can display multiple columns for each list item when in the **Details** view. You can use the columns to display several types of information about each list item. For example, a list of files could display the file name, file type, size, and date the file was last modified. For information on populating the columns once they are created, see [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md).  
  
 The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To add columns in the designer  
  
1.  In the **Properties** window, set the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View.Details>.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property.  
  
     The **ColumnHeader Collection Editor** appears.  
  
3.  Use the **Add** button to add new columns. You can then select the column header and set its text (the caption of the column), text alignment, and width.
