# How to: Design a Windows Forms Layout that Responds Well to Localization
Creating forms that are ready to be localized greatly speeds development for international markets. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to implement layouts that respond gracefully as controls resize due to changes in their <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property values.  
  
## Example  
 This form demonstrates how to create a layout that proportionally adjusts when you translate displayed string values into other languages. This process of translation is called *localization*. For more information, see [Localization](../../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/localization.md).  
  
 There is extensive support for this task in Visual Studio.  See also [Walkthrough: Creating a Layout That Adjusts Proportion for Localization](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7k9fa71y\(v=vs.110\)).

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\(v=vs.110\)).
