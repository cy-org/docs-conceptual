# How to: Move Through a DataSet with the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control
As you build data-driven applications, you will often need to display collections of data to users. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control, in conjunction with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, provides a convenient and extensible solution for moving through a collection and displaying items sequentially.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control to move through data. The set is contained in a <xref:System.Data.DataView>, which is bound to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing, System.Windows.Forms and System.Xml assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
