# How to: Play a Sound Embedded in a Resource from a Windows Form
You can use the <xref:System.Media.SoundPlayer> class to play a sound from an embedded resource.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.Sound#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Sound/CS/soundtestform.cs#10)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.Sound#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Sound/VB/soundtestform.vb#10)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
 Importing the <xref:System.Media?displayProperty=fullName> namespace.  
  
 Including the sound file as an embedded resource in your project.  
  
 Replacing "\<AssemblyName>" with the name of the assembly in which the sound file is embedded. Do not include the ".dll" suffix.
