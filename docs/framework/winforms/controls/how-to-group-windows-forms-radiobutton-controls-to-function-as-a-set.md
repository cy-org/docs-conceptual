# How to: Group Windows Forms RadioButton Controls to Function as a Set
Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls are designed to give users a choice among two or more settings, of which only one can be assigned to a procedure or object. For example, a group of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls may display a choice of package carriers for an order, but only one of the carriers will be used. Therefore only one <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> at a time can be selected, even if it is a part of a functional group.  
  
 You group radio buttons by drawing them inside a container such as a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, or a form. All radio buttons that are added directly to a form become one group. To add separate groups, you must place them inside panels or group boxes. For more information about panels or group boxes, see [Panel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md) or [GroupBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md).  
  
### To group RadioButton controls as a set to function independently of other sets  
  
1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control from the **Windows Forms** tab on the **Toolbox** onto the form.  
  
2.  Draw <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control.
