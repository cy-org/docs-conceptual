# How to: Play a Beep from a Windows Form
This example plays a beep at run time.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Public Sub OnePing()  
    Beep()  
End Sub  
```  
  
```csharp  
public void onePing()  
{  
    SystemSounds.Beep.Play();  
}  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The sound played in the C# code sample is determined by the <xref:System.Media.SystemSounds.Beep%2A> system sound setting. For more information, see <xref:System.Media.SystemSounds>.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 For C#, this example requires  a reference to the <xref:System.Media?displayProperty=fullName> namespace.
