# RichTextBox Control (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms `RichTextBox` control is used for displaying, entering, and manipulating text with formatting. The `RichTextBox` control does everything the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control does, but it can also display fonts, colors, and links; load text and embedded images from a file; undo and redo editing operations; and find specified characters. The `RichTextBox` control is typically used to provide text manipulation and display features similar to word processing applications such as Microsoft Word. Like the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control, the `RichTextBox` control can display scroll bars; but unlike the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control, it displays both horizontal and vertical scrollbars by default and has additional scrollbar settings.
