# How to: Handle Errors That Occur During Data Entry in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control
The following code example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to report data entry errors to the user.  
  
 For a complete explanation of this code example, see [Walkthrough: Handling Errors that Occur During Data Entry in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/handling-errors-that-occur-during-data-entry-in-the-datagrid.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#00](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/CS/errorhandling.cs#00)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#00](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/VB/errorhandling.vb#00)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Windows.Forms, and System.XML assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).
