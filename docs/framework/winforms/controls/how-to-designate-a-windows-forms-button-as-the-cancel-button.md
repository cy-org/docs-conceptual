# How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button
On any Windows Form, you can designate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control to be the cancel button. A cancel button is clicked whenever the user presses the ESC key, regardless of which other control on the form has the focus. Such a button is usually programmed to enable the user to quickly exit an operation without committing to any action.  
  
### To designate the cancel button  
  
1.  Set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.CancelButton%2A> property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub SetCancelButton(ByVal myCancelBtn As Button)  
       Me.CancelButton = myCancelBtn  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void SetCancelButton(Button myCancelBtn)  
    {  
       this.CancelButton = myCancelBtn;  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:  
       void SetCancelButton(Button ^ myCancelBtn)  
       {  
          this->CancelButton = myCancelBtn;  
       }  
    ```
