# How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button Using the Designer
On any Windows Form, you can designate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control to be the cancel button. A cancel button is clicked whenever the user presses the ESC key, regardless of which other control on the form has the focus. Such a button is usually programmed to enable the user to quickly exit an operation without committing to any action.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To designate the cancel button  
  
1.  Select the form on which the button resides.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.CancelButton%2A> property to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's name.
