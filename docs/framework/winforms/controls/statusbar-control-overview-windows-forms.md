# StatusBar Control Overview (Windows Forms)
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripStatusLabel> controls replace and add functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanel> controls; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanel> controls are retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  
  
 The Windows Forms [StatusBar Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/statusbar-control-windows-forms.md) is used on forms as an area, usually displayed at the bottom of a window, in which an application can display various kinds of status information. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> controls can have status bar panels on them that display text or icons to indicate state, or a series of icons in an animation that indicate a process is working; for example, [!INCLUDE[ofprword](../../../../includes/ofprword-md.md)] indicating that the document is being saved.  
  
## Using the StatusBar Control  
 Internet Explorer uses a status bar to indicate the URL of a page when the mouse rolls over the hyperlink; [!INCLUDE[ofprword](../../../../includes/ofprword-md.md)] gives you information on page location, section location, and editing modes such as overtype and revision tracking; and [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] uses the status bar to give context-sensitive information, such as telling you how to manipulate dockable windows as either docked or floating.  
  
 You can display a single message on the status bar by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.ShowPanels%2A> property to `false` (the default) and setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.Text%2A> property of the status bar to the text you want to appear in the status bar. You can divide the status bar into panels to display more than one type of information by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.ShowPanels%2A> property to `true` and using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.StatusBarPanelCollection.Add%2A> method of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.StatusBarPanelCollection>.
