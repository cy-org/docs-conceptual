# How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control can be single-line or multi-line, and it can be either fixed in size or can automatically resize itself to accommodate its caption. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property helps you size the controls to fit larger or smaller captions, which is particularly useful if the caption will change at run time.  
  
### To make a label control resize dynamically to fit its contents  
  
1.  Set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property to `true`.  
  
 If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> is set to `false`, the words specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.Text%2A> property will wrap to the next line if possible, but the control will not grow.
