# FlowLayoutPanel Control (Windows Forms)
The `FlowLayoutPanel` control arranges its contents in a horizontal or vertical flow direction. Its contents can be wrapped from one row to the next, or from one column to the next. Alternately, its contents can be clipped instead of wrapped.  
  
 The topics in this section describe the concepts and techniques that allow you to build `FlowLayoutPanel` features into your applications.

 [FlowLayoutPanel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/flowlayoutpanel-control-overview.md)
