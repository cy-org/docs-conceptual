# How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control displays a hierarchy of nodes, similar to the files and folders displayed in the left pane of the Windows Explorer feature in Windows operating systems. By setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ContextMenuStrip%2A> property, you can provide context-sensitive operations to the user when they right-click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control. By associating a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> component with individual <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> items, you can add a customized level of shortcut menu functionality to your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> controls.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To associate a shortcut menu with a TreeNode at design time  
  
1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control to your form, and then add nodes to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> as needed. For more information, see [How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-and-remove-nodes-with-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md).  
  
2.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> component to your form, and then add menu items to the shortcut menu that represent node-level operations you wish to make available at run time. For more information, see [How to: Add Menu Items to a ContextMenuStrip](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-menu-items-to-a-contextmenustrip.md).  
  
3.  Reopen the **TreeNodeEditor** dialog box for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control, select the node to edit, and set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> property to the shortcut menu that you added.  
  
4.  When this property is set, the shortcut menu will be displayed when you right-click the node.  
  
     Additionally, you will want to write code to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.Click> events for these menu items.
