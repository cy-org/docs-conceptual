# How to: Navigate Data with the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control
The advent of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control in Windows Forms enables developers to provide end users with a simple data navigation and manipulation user interface on the forms they create.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control with buttons preconfigured for navigation to the first, last, next, and previous record in a data set, as well as buttons to add and delete records. Adding buttons to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control is easy, because it is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control.  Also see [How to: Add Load, Save, and Cancel Buttons to the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/safa4957\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
 For each button on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control, there is a corresponding member of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component that programmatically allows the same functionality. For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.MoveFirstItem%2A> button corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.MoveFirst%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.DeleteItem%2A> button corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.RemoveCurrent%2A> method, and so on. As a result, enabling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control to navigate data records is a simple as setting its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.BindingSource%2A> property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component on the form.  
  
### To set up the BindingNavigator control  
  
1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component named `bindingSource1` and two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> controls named `textBox1` and `textBox2`.  
  
2.  Bind `bindingSource1` to data, and the textbox controls to `bindingSource1`. To do this, paste the following code into your form and call `LoadData` from the form's constructor or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event-handling method.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/CS/Form1.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  
  
3.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control named `bindingNavigator1` to your form.  
  
4.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.BindingSource%2A> property for `bindingNavigator1` to `bindingSource1`. You can do this with the designer or in code.

     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  
  
## Example  
 The following code example is the complete example for the steps listed previously.  
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing, System.Windows.Forms and System.Xml assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
