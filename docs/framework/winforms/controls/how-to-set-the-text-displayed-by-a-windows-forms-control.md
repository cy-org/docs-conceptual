# How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control
Windows Forms controls usually display some text that is related to the primary function of the control. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control usually displays a caption indicating what action will be performed when the button is clicked. For all controls, you can set or return the text by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property. You can change the font by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property. You can also set the text using the designer.  Also see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233673\(v=vs.110\)), [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233665\(v=vs.110\)), [How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233656\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
### To set the text displayed by a control programmatically  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property to a string.  
  
     To create an underlined access key, includes an ampersand (&) before the letter that will be the access key.  
  
2.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property to an object of type <xref:System.Drawing.Font>.  
  
    ```vb  
    Button1.Text = "Click here to save changes"  
    Button1.Font = New Font("Arial", 10, FontStyle.Bold, GraphicsUnit.Point)  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    button1.Text = "Click here to save changes";  
    button1.Font = new Font("Arial", 10, FontStyle.Bold,  
       GraphicsUnit.Point);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    button1->Text = "Click here to save changes";  
    button1->Font = new System::Drawing::Font("Arial",  
       10, FontStyle::Bold, GraphicsUnit::Point);  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can use an escape character to display a special character in user-interface elements that would normally interpret them differently, such as menu items. For example, the following line of code sets the menu item's text to read "& Now For Something Completely Different":  
  
    ```vb  
    MPMenuItem.Text = "&& Now For Something Completely Different"  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    mpMenuItem.Text = "&& Now For Something Completely Different";  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    mpMenuItem->Text = "&& Now For Something Completely Different";  
    ```
