# How to: Create an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control
The following code example demonstrates how to populate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control programmatically without binding it to a data source. This is useful when you have a small amount of data that you want to display in a table format.  
  
 For a complete explanation of this code example, see [Walkthrough: Creating an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-creating-an-unbound-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#00](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#00)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#00](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#00)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\(v=vs.110\)).
