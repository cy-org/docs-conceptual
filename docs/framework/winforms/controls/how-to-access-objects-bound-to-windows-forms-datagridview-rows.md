# How to: Access Objects Bound to Windows Forms DataGridView Rows
Sometimes it is useful to display a table of information stored in a collection of business objects. When you bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to such a collection, each public property is displayed in its own column unless the property has been marked non-browsable with a <xref:System.ComponentModel.BrowsableAttribute>. For example, a collection of `Customer` objects would have columns such as **Name** and **Address**.  
  
 If these objects contain additional information and code that you want to access, you can reach it through row objects. In the following code example, users can select multiple rows and click a button to send an invoice to each of the corresponding customers.  
  
### To access row-bound objects  
  
-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow.DataBoundItem%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding/CS/datagridviewobjectbinding.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding/VB/datagridviewobjectbinding.vb#10)]  
  
## Example  
 The complete code example includes a simple `Customer` implementation and binds the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> containing a few `Customer` objects. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event handler of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button?displayProperty=fullName> must access the `Customer` objects through the rows, because the customer collection is not accessible outside the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load?displayProperty=fullName> event handler.

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
