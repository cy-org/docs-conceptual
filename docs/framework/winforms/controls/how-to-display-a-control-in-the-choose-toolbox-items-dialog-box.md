# How to: Display a Control in the Choose Toolbox Items Dialog Box
As you develop and distribute controls, you may want those controls to appear in the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box, which is displayed when you right-click the **Toolbox** and select **Choose Items**. You can enable your control to appear in this dialog box by using the AssemblyFoldersEx registration procedure.  
  
### To display your control in the Choose Toolbox Items dialog box  
  
-   Install your control assembly to the global assembly cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md)  
  
     -or-  
  
-   Register your control and its associated design-time assemblies by using the AssemblyFoldersEx registration procedure. AssemblyFoldersEx is a registry location where third-party vendors store paths for each version of the framework that they support. Design-time resolution can look in this registry location to find reference assemblies. The registry script can specify the controls you want to appear in the Toolbox. For more information, see [Deploying a Custom Control and Design-time Assemblies (Visual Studio 2013)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/96158eb0-b691-4ae1-9e7b-3c65a1b798cb).
