# PrintPreviewDialog Control (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms `PrintPreviewDialog` control is a pre-configured dialog box used to display how a document will appear when printed. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. The control contains buttons for printing, zooming in, displaying one or multiple pages, and closing the dialog box.
