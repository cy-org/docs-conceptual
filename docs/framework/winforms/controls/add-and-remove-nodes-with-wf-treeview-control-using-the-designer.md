# How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer
Because the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control displays nodes in a hierarchical manner, when adding a node you must pay attention to what its parent node is.  
  
 The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To add or remove nodes in the designer  
  
1.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property.  
  
     The **TreeNode Editor** appears.  
  
3.  To add nodes, a root node must exist; if one does not exist, you must first add a root by clicking the **Add Root** button. You can then add child nodes by selecting the root or any other node and clicking the **Add Child** button.  
  
4.  To delete nodes, select the node to delete and then click the **Delete** button.
