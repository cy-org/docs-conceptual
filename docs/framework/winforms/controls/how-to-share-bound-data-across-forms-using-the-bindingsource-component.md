# How to: Share Bound Data Across Forms Using the BindingSource Component
You can easily share data across forms using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. For example, you may want to display one read-only form that summarizes the data-source data and another editable form that contains detailed information about the currently selected item in the data source. This example demonstrates this scenario.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to share a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> and its bound data across forms. In this example, the shared <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is passed to the constructor of the child form. The child form allows the user to edit the data for the currently selected item in the main form.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.BindingComplete> event for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component is handled in the example to ensure that the two forms remain synchronized. For more information about why this is done, see [How to: Ensure Multiple Controls Bound to the Same Data Source Remain Synchronized](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/multiple-controls-bound-to-data-source-synchronized.md).

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Windows.Forms, System.Drawing, System.Data, and System.Xml assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
