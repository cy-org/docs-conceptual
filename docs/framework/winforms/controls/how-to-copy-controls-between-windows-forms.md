# How to: Copy Controls Between Windows Forms
A control may be copied onto the same form, onto another form within the project, or onto the Clipboard for use in other solutions.  
  
### To copy a control  
  
1.  Select the control, and from the **Edit** menu choose **Copy**.  
  
 This control can now be pasted to any form that accepts that type of control. Additionally, the control has been added to the Clipboard.
