# How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control
The following code example shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> image columns in an interactive user interface (UI). The example also demonstrates image sizing and layout possibilities with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn>.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe#0](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe/CPP/tictactoe.cpp#0)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe/CS/tictactoe.cs#0)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe/VB/tictactoe.vb#0)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
