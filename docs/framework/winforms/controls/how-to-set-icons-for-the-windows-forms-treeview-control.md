# How to: Set Icons for the Windows Forms TreeView Control
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control can display icons next to each node. The icons are positioned to the immediate left of the node text. To display these icons, you must associate the tree view with an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> control. For more information about image lists, see [ImageList Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/imagelist-component-windows-forms.md) and [How to: Add or Remove Images with the Windows Forms ImageList Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-or-remove-images-with-the-windows-forms-imagelist-component.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A bug in Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.1 prevents images from appearing on <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> nodes when your application calls <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. To work around this bug, call <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents%2A?displayProperty=fullName> in your `Main` method immediately after calling <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A>. This bug is fixed in [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../../../../includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)].  
  
### To display images in a tree view  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.ImageList%2A> property to the existing <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> control you wish to use.  
  
     These properties can be set in the designer with the Properties window, or in code.  
  
    ```vb  
    TreeView1.ImageList = ImageList1  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    treeView1.ImageList = imageList1;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    treeView1->ImageList = imageList1;  
    ```  
  
2.  Set the node's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.ImageIndex%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.SelectedImageIndex%2A> properties. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.ImageIndex%2A> property determines the image displayed for the node's normal and expanded states, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.SelectedImageIndex%2A> property determines the image displayed for the node's selected state.  
  
     These properties can be set in code, or within the TreeNode Editor. To open the TreeNode Editor, click the ellipsis button ( ![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png "vbEllipsesButton")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property on the Properties window.  
  
    ```vb  
    ' (Assumes that ImageList1 contains at least two images and  
    ' the TreeView control contains a selected image.)  
    TreeView1.SelectedNode.ImageIndex = 0  
    TreeView1.SelectedNode.SelectedImageIndex = 1  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    // (Assumes that imageList1 contains at least two images and  
    // the TreeView control contains a selected image.)  
    treeView1.SelectedNode.ImageIndex = 0;  
    treeView1.SelectedNode.SelectedImageIndex = 1;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    // (Assumes that imageList1 contains at least two images and  
    // the TreeView control contains a selected image.)  
    treeView1->SelectedNode->ImageIndex = 0;  
    treeView1->SelectedNode->SelectedImageIndex = 1;  
    ```
