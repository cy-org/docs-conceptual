# How To: Opt Out of File Dialog Box Automatic Upgrade
When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> classes are used in an application, their appearance and behavior depend on the version of Windows the application is running on. When an application that was created on the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnext](../../../../includes/dnprdnext-md.md)] or earlier is displayed on [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../../../../includes/wiprlhext-md.md)], <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> are automatically displayed with the [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../../../../includes/wiprlhext-md.md)] appearance and behavior. Starting in the [!INCLUDE[net_v30_short](../../../../includes/net-v30-short-md.md)], you can opt out of the automatic upgrade to display the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> with a [!INCLUDE[winxp](../../../../includes/winxp-md.md)]-style appearance and behavior.  
  
### To opt out of file dialog box automatic upgrade  
  
1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.AutoUpgradeEnabled%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> to `false` before you display the dialog box.
