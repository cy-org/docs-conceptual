# TextBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)
Windows Forms text boxes are used to get input from the user or to display text. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control is generally used for editable text, although it can also be made read-only. Text boxes can display multiple lines, wrap text to the size of the control, and add basic formatting. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control provides a single format style for text displayed or entered into the control. To display multiple types of formatted text, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox> control. For more information, see [RichTextBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/richtextbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md).  
  
## Working with the TextBox Control  
 The text displayed by the control is contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property. By default, you can enter up to 2048 characters in a text box. If you set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Multiline%2A> property to `true`, you can enter up to 32 KB of text. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property can be set at design time with the Properties Window, at run time in code, or by user input at run time. The current contents of a text box can be retrieved at run time by reading the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property.  
  
 The following code example sets text in the control at run time. The `InitializeMyControl` procedure will not execute automatically; it must be called.  
  
```vb  
Private Sub InitializeMyControl()  
   ' Put some text into the control first.  
   TextBox1.Text = "This is a TextBox control."  
End Sub  
```  
  
```csharp  
private void InitializeMyControl() {  
   // Put some text into the control first.  
   textBox1.Text = "This is a TextBox control.";  
}  
```  
  
```cpp  
private:  
   void InitializeMyControl()  
   {  
      // Put some text into the control first.  
      textBox1->Text = "This is a TextBox control.";  
   }  
```
