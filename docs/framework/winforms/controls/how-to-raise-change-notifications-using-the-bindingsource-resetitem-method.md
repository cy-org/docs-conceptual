# How to: Raise Change Notifications Using the BindingSource ResetItem Method
Some data sources for your controls do not raise change notifications when items are changed, added, or deleted. With the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, you can bind to such data sources and raise a change notification from your code.  
  
## Example  
 This form demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind a list to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. The list does not raise change notifications, so the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetItem%2A> method on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is called when an item in the list is changed. .

 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem/CS/form1.cs#1)]

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
