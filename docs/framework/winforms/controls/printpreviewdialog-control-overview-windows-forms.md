# PrintPreviewDialog Control Overview (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control is a pre-configured dialog box used to display how a [PrintDocument](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdocument-component-windows-forms.md) will appear when printed. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution instead of configuring your own dialog box. The control contains buttons for printing, zooming in, displaying one or multiple pages, and closing the dialog box.  
  
## Key Properties and Methods  
 The control's key property is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog.Document%2A>, which sets the document to be previewed. The document must be a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> object. In order to display the dialog box, you must call its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A> method. Anti-aliasing can make the text appear smoother, but it can also make the display slower; to use it, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog.UseAntiAlias%2A> property to `true`.  
  
 Certain properties are available through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl> that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> contains. (You do not have to add this <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl> to the form; it is automatically contained within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> when you add the dialog to your form.) Examples of properties available through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl> are the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Columns%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Rows%2A> properties, which determine the number of pages displayed horizontally and vertically on the control. You can access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Columns%2A> property as `PrintPreviewDialog1.PrintPreviewControl.Columns` in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], `printPreviewDialog1.PrintPreviewControl.Columns` in [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], or `printPreviewDialog1->PrintPreviewControl->Columns` in [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)].
