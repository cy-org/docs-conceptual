# How to: Load a Picture Using the Designer (Windows Forms)
With the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control, you can load and display a picture on a form at design time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property to a valid picture. The following table shows the acceptable file types.  
  
|Type|File name extension|  
|----------|-------------------------|  
|Bitmap|.bmp|  
|Icon|.ico|  
|GIF|.gif|  
|Metafile|.wmf|  
|JPEG|.jpg|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
### To display a picture at design time  
  
1.  Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control on a form.  
  
2.  On the Properties window, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property, then click the ellipsis button to display the **Open** dialog box.  
  
3.  If you are looking for a specific file type (for example, .gif files), select it in the **Files of type** box.  
  
4.  Select the file you want to display.  
  
### To clear the picture at design time  
  
1.  On the **Properties** window, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property and right-click the small thumbnail image that appears to the left of the name of the image object. Choose **Reset**.
