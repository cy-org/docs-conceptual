# How to: Run an Operation in the Background
If you have an operation that will take a long time to complete, and you do not want to cause delays in your user interface, you can use the <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker> class to run the operation on another thread.  
  
 The following code example shows how to run a time-consuming operation in the background. The form has **Start** and **Cancel** buttons. Click the **Start** button to run an asynchronous operation. Click the **Cancel** button to stop a running asynchronous operation. The outcome of each operation is displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox>.  
  
 There is extensive support for this task in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  
  
 Also see [Walkthrough: Running an Operation in the Background](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233672\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\(v=vs.110\)).
