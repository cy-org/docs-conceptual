# How to: Implement Virtual Mode with Just-In-Time Data Loading in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control
The following code example shows how to use virtual mode in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control with a data cache that loads data from a server only when it is needed. This example is described in detail in [Implementing Virtual Mode with Just-In-Time Data Loading in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/implementing-virtual-mode-jit-data-loading-in-the-datagrid.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading#000](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading/CS/lazyloading.cs#000)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading#000](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading/VB/lazyloading.vb#000)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Xml, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  
  
-   Access to a server with the Northwind SQL Server sample database installed.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\(v=vs.110\)).  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).
