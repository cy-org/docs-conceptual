# How to: Disable Buttons in a Button Column in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control
The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control includes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell> class for displaying cells with a user interface (UI) like a button. However, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell> does not provide a way to disable the appearance of the button displayed by the cell.  
  
 The following code example demonstrates how to customize the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell> class to display buttons that can appear disabled. The example defines a new cell type, `DataGridViewDisableButtonCell`, that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell>. This cell type provides a new `Enabled` property that can be set to `false` to draw a disabled button in the cell. The example also defines a new column type, `DataGridViewDisableButtonColumn`, that displays `DataGridViewDisableButtonCell` objects. To demonstrate this new cell and column type, the current value of each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxCell> in the parent <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> determines whether the `Enabled` property of the `DataGridViewDisableButtonCell` in the same row is `true` or `false`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you derive from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> and add new properties to the derived class, be sure to override the `Clone` method to copy the new properties during cloning operations. You should also call the base class's `Clone` method so that the properties of the base class are copied to the new cell or column.

## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   References to the System, System.Drawing, System.Windows.Forms and System.Windows.Forms.VisualStyles assemblies.  
  
 For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
