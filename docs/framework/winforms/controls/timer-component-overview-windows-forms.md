# Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> is a component that raises an event at regular intervals. This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment. If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see [Introduction to Server-Based Timers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/adc0bc0a-a519-4812-bafc-fb9d1a5801fc).  
  
## Key Properties, Methods, and Events  
 The length of the intervals is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property, whose value is in milliseconds. When the component is enabled, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event is raised every interval. This is where you would add code to be executed. For more information, see [How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md). The key methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A>, which turn the timer on and off. When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component.
