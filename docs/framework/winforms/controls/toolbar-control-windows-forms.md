# ToolBar Control (Windows Forms)
> [!NOTE]
>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control replaces and adds functionality to the `ToolBar` control; however, the `ToolBar` control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  
  
 The Windows Forms `ToolBar` control is used on forms as a control bar that displays a row of drop-down menus and bitmapped buttons that activate commands. Thus, clicking a toolbar button is equivalent to choosing a menu command. The buttons can be configured to appear and behave as push buttons, drop-down menus, or separators. Typically, a toolbar contains buttons and menus that correspond to items in an application's menu structure, providing quick access to an application's most frequently used functions and commands.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `ToolBar` control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBarButton.DropDownMenu%2A> property takes an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> class as a reference. Carefully consider the reference you pass when implementing this sort of button on toolbars in your application, as the property will accept any object that inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Menu> class.
