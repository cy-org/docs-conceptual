# Troubleshoot blocked .NET Framework installations and uninstallations

When you run the [web or offline installer](../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md) for the .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions, you might encounter an issue that prevents or blocks the installation of the .NET Framework. The following table lists possible blocking issues and provides links to troubleshooting information.

In Windows 8 and above, the .NET Framework is an operating system component and cannot be independently uninstalled. Updates to the .NET Framework appear in the **Installed Updates** tab of the Control Panel **Programs and Features** app. For operating systems on which the .NET Framework is not preinstalled, the .NET Framework appears in the **Uninstall or change a program** tab (or the **Add/Remove programs** tab) of the **Program and Features** app in Control Panel. For information on the Windows versions on which the .NET Framework is preinstalled, see [System Requirements](../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the 4.x versions of the .NET Framework are in-place updates, you cannot install an earlier version of the .NET Framework 4.x on a system with that already has a later version installed. For example, on a system with Windows 10 Creators Update, you cannot install the .NET Framework 4.6.2, since the .NET Framework 4.7 is preinstalled with the operating system.

You can determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed on a system. See [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed.md) for more information.

In this table, 4.5.*x* refers to the .NET Framework 4.5 and its point releases, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2, 4.6.*x* refers to the .NET Framework 4.6 and its point releases, 4.6.1 and 4.6.2, and 4.7 refers to the .NET Framework 4.7.

### Program compatibility issues

The installation of the .NET Framework 4.5 or its point releases fails with a 1603 error code or blocks when it's running in Windows Program Compatibility mode. The **Program Compatibility Assistant** indicates that the .NET Framework might not have been installed correctly and prompts you to reinstall it by using the recommended setting (Program Compatibility mode). Program Compatibility mode could also have been set by the Program Compatibility Assistant on earlier failed or canceled attempts to run the .NET Framework Setup.

The .NET Framework installer cannot run in Program Compatibility mode. To resolve this blocking issue, you must ensure that the compatibility mode setting is not enabled systemwide in Registry Editor:

1. Choose the **Start** button, and then choose **Run**.

1. In the **Run** dialog box, type "regedit", and then choose **OK**.

1. In Registry Editor, browse to the following subkeys:

   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Persisted

   - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers

1. In the Name column, look for the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, or 4.6.2 download names, depending on which version you are installing, and delete these entries. For download names, see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md) article.

1. Rerun the .NET Framework installer for version 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, or 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7.
