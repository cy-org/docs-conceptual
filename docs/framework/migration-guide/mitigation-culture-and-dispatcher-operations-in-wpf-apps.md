# Mitigation: Culture and Dispatcher Operations in WPF Apps
In apps that target the .NET Framework 4.6 and the .NET Framework 4.6.1, changes to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties that are made within a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> are lost at the end of that dispatcher operation. Similarly, changes to <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> made outside of a dispatcher operation may not be reflected when that operation executes.  
  
 This is due to a change in <xref:System.Threading.ExecutionContext> that causes the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to be stored in the execution context. WPF dispatcher operations store the execution context used to begin the operation and restore the previous context when the operation is completed. Because <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> are now part of that context, changes to them within a dispatcher operation are not persisted outside of the operation.  
  
## Impact  
 Practically, this means that changes to the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and  <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties may not flow between WPF UI callbacks and other code in a WPF application.  
  
## Mitigation  
 Apps affected by this change may work around it in either of two ways:  
  
-   By storing the desired <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or  <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> in a field and checking in all <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> operation bodies (including UI event callback handlers) that the correct <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or  <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is set.  
  
-   Because the change to <xref:System.Threading.ExecutionContext> only affects WPF apps that target the .NET Framework 4.6 or the .NET Framework 4.6.1, this change can be avoided by targeting the .NET Framework 4.5.2 or by targeting a version of the .NET Framework starting with 4.6.2.
