# Mitigation: Path Colon Checks
Starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)], a number of changes were made to support previously unsupported paths (both in terms of length and format). In particular, checks for the proper drive separator syntax (the colon) were made more correct.  
  
## Impact  
 These changes block some URI paths the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods previously supported.  
  
## Mitigation  
 To work around the problem of a previously acceptable path that is no longer supported by the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods, you can do the following:  
  
-   Manually remove the scheme from a URL. For example, remove `file://` from a URL.  
  
-   Pass the URI to a <xref:System.Uri> constructor,  and retrieve the value of the <xref:System.Uri.LocalPath%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  
  
-   Opt out of the new path normalization by setting the `Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling`<xref:System.AppContext> switch to `true`.  
  
    ```xml  
    <runtime>  
        <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling=true" />    
    </runtime>  
    ```
