If you are migrating from the .NET Framework 4.5 to 4.5.1, review the following topics for application compatibility issues that may affect your app:

## ADO.NET

[!include[ADO.NET now attempts to automatically reconnect broken SQL connections](../../../../includes/migration-guide/runtime/adonet/adonet-now-attempts-automatically-reconnect-broken-sql-connections.md)]

## Core

[!include[A ConcurrentDictionary serialized in .NET 4.5 with NetDataContractSerializer cannot be deserialized by .NET 4.5.1 or 4.5.2](../../../../includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/concurrentdictionary-serialized-net-45-with-netdatacontractserializer-cannot.md)]

[!include[ConcurrentQueue&lt;T&gt;.TryPeek can return an erroneous null via its out parameter](../../../../includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/concurrentqueuelttgttrypeek-can-return-an-erroneous-null-via-its-out.md)]

[!include[EventSource.WriteEvent impls must pass WriteEvent the same parameters that it received (plus ID)](../../../../includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/eventsourcewriteevent-impls-must-pass-writeevent-same-parameters-that-it.md)]

[!include[Marshal.SizeOf and Marshal.PtrToStructure overloads break dynamic code](../../../../includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/marshalsizeof-marshalptrtostructure-overloads-break-dynamic-code.md)]

[!include[Some .NET APIs cause first chance (handled) EntryPointNotFoundExceptions](../../../../includes/migration-guide/runtime/core/some-net-apis-cause-first-chance-handled-entrypointnotfoundexceptions.md)]
