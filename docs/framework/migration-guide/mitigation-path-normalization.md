# Mitigation: Path Normalization
Starting with apps the target  the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)], path normalization in the .NET Framework has changed.  
  
## What is path normalization?  
 Normalizing a path involves modifying the string that identifies a path or file so that it conforms to a valid path on the target operating system. Normalization typically involves:  
  
-   Canonicalizing component and directory separators.  
  
-   Applying the current directory to a relative path.  
  
-   Evaluating the relative directory (`.`) or the parent directory (`..`) in a path.  
  
-   Trimming specified characters.  
  
## The changes  
 Starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)], path normalization has changed in the following ways:  
  
-   The runtime defers to the operating system's [GetFullPathName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa364963\(v=vs.85\).aspx) function to normalize paths.  
  
-   Normalization no longer involves trimming the end of directory segments (such as a space at the end of a directory name).  
  
-   Support for device path syntax in full trust, including  `\\.\` and, for file I/O APIs   in mscorlib.dll, `\\?\`.  
  
-   The runtime does not validate device syntax paths.  
  
-   The use of device syntax to access alternate data streams is supported.  
  
## Impact  
 For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] or later, these changes are on  by default. They should improve performance while allowing methods to access previously inaccessible paths.  
  
 Apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and earlier versions but are running under the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] or later are unaffected by this change.  
  
## Mitigation  
 Apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] or later can opt out of this change and use legacy normalization by adding the following to the [\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the application configuration file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>  
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling=true" />    
</runtime>  
```  
  
 Apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] or earlier but are running on the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] or later can enable the changes to path normalization by adding the following line to the [\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the application .configuration file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>  
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling=false" />    
</runtime>  
```
