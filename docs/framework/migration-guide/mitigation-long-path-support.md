# Mitigation: Long Path Support
Starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)],  file system I/O methods not longer automatically throw a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> if a path or fully qualified file name exceeds 260 (or `MAX_PATH`) characters. Instead, long paths of up to 32K characters are supported.  
  
## Impact  
 Apps recompiled to target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] and that previously threw a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> automatically because a path exceeded 260 characters will now throw a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> only under the following conditions:  
  
-   The length of the path is greater than  <xref:System.Int16.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName> (32,767) characters.  
  
-   The operating system returns `COR_E_PATHTOOLONG` or its equivalent.  
  
 The legacy behavior for apps that target the[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and earlier is that the runtime automatically throws a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> whenever a path exceeds 260 characters.  
  
## Mitigation  
 For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)], you can opt out of long path support if it is not desirable by adding the following to    to the [\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your app.config file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>   
   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IO.BlockLongPaths=true" />   
</runtime>  
```  
  
 For apps that target earlier versions of the .NET Framework but run on the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] or later., you can opt in to long path support by adding the following to    to the [\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your app.config file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>   
   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IO.BlockLongPaths=false" />   
</runtime>  
```
