# Mitigation: Product Versioning
In the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] and later, product versioning has changed from the previous releases of the .NET Framework (the .NET Framework 4, 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2).  
  
## Product versioning changes  
 The following are the detailed changes:  
  
-   The value of the `Version` entry in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full` key has changed to `4.6.`*xxxxx* for the .NET Framework 4.6 and its point releases, and to `4.7.`*xxxxx* for the .NET Framework 4.7. In the .NET Framework 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2, it had the format `4.5.`*xxxxx*.  
  
-   The file and product versioning for .NET Framework files has changed from the earlier versioning scheme of `4.0.30319.x` to `4.6.X.0` for the .NET Framework 4.6 and its point releases, and to `4.7.X.0` for the .NET Framework 4.7 and its point releases. You can see these new values when you view the file's **Properties** after right-clicking on a file.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyFileVersionAttribute> and <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute> attributes for managed assemblies have <xref:System.Version> values in the form `4.6.X.0` for the .NET Framework 4.6 and its point releases, and `4.7.X.0` for the .NET Framework 4.7.  
  
-   In the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)], 4.6.1, 4.6.2, and 4.7, the <xref:System.Environment.Version%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns the fixed version string `4.0.30319.42000`. In the .NET Framework 4, 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2, it returns version strings in the format `4.0.30319.xxxxx` (for example, "4.0.30319.18010"). Note that we do not recommend application code taking any new dependency on the <xref:System.Environment.Version%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  
  
### Handling the product versioning changes  
 In general, applications should depend on the recommended techniques for detecting such things as the runtime version of the .NET Framework and the installation directory:  
  
-   To detect the runtime version of the .NET Framework, see [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed.md).  
  
-   To determine the installation path for the .NET Framework, use the value of the `InstallPath` entry in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full` key.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  The subkey name is `NET Framework Setup`, not `.NET Framework Setup`.  
  
-   To determine the directory path to the .NET Framework common language runtime, call the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment.GetRuntimeDirectory%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  
  
-   To get the CLR version, call the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeEnvironment.GetSystemVersion%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.   For the .NET Framework 4 and its point releases (the .NET Framework 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)], 4.6.1, 4.6.2, and 4.7), it returns the string `v4.0.30319`.
