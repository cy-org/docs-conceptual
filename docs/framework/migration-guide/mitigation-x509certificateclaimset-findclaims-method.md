# Mitigation: X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims Method
Starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)],  the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method will attempt to match the `claimType` argument with all the DNS entries in its SAN field.  
  
## Impact  
 This change only affects apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)].  
  
 For apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework, the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method attempts to match the `claimType` argument only with the last  DNS entry.  
  
## Mitigation  
 If this change is undesirable, apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] can opt out of it by adding the following configuration setting to the [\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>  
   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableMultipleDNSEntriesInSANCertificate=true" />   
</runtime>  
```  
  
 In addition, apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework but are running under the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and later versions can opt in to this behavior by adding the following configuration setting to the [\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  
  
```xml  
<runtime>  
    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value="Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableMultipleDNSEntriesInSANCertificate=false" />   
</runtime>  
```
