# Mitigation: minFreeMemoryPercentageToActiveService Configuration Setting
In the [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)], an exception is thrown if the available memory on the web server is less than the percentage specified by the [minFreeMemoryPercentageToActivateService](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicehostingenvironment.md) configuration setting. In the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], this setting was ignored.  
  
## Impact  
 In most cases, the impact of observing the [minFreeMemoryPercentageToActivateService](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicehostingenvironment.md) setting is desirable: It improves system stability by preventing the <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException> exceptions that can occur when a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service is started on a system that has constrained memory.  
  
 However, in some cases, a service that previously started successfully may be unable to start. In that case, a detailed error message appears:  
  
```console
Memory gates checking failed because the free memory (nnnn bytes) is less than nn% of total memory. As a result, the service will not be available for incoming requests. To resolve this, either reduce the load on the machine or adjust the value of minFreeMemoryPercentageToActivateService on the serviceHostingEnvironment config element.
```
  
## Mitigation  
 To revert to the previous behavior where the [minFreeMemoryPercentageToActivateService](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicehostingenvironment.md) setting was ignored, modify the web.config file as follows:  
  
```xml
<serviceHostingEnvironment multipleSiteBindingsEnabled="true"   
                           minFreeMemoryPercentageToActivateService="0">  
   <serviceActivations>  
   ...  
   </serviceActivations>  
</serviceHostingEnvironment>  
```
