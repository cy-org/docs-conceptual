# Mitigation: EventSource.WriteEvent Method Calls
The [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)] enforces a contract between an ETW event method in a class that is derived from <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource?displayProperty=fullName> and  the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.WriteEvent%2A> method of its base class. The ETW event method must pass the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.WriteEvent%2A> method the event ID followed by the same arguments that were passed to the event method.  
  
## Impact  
 An ETW event method defined in the following way breaks the contract:  
  
```  
[Event(2, Level = EventLevel.Informational)]  
public void Info2(string message)  
{  
   base.WriteEvent(2, message, "-");  
}  
```  
  
 When this contract is violated, an <xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException> exception is thrown at run time if an <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventListener> object reads <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource> data in process.  
  
 The definition for this ETW event method should follow this pattern:  
  
```  
[Event(2, Level = EventLevel.Informational)]  
public void Info2(string message)  
{  
   base.WriteEvent(2, message);  
}  
```  
  
## Mitigation  
 You must modify existing code to conform to the required pattern.  
  
 You can minimize the amount of code that you have to change by defining two methods for calling the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.WriteEvent%2A> method, as follows:  
  
```  
[NonEvent]  
public void Info2(string message)  
{  
   Info2Internal(message, "-");  
}  
  
public void Info2Internal(string message, string prefix)  
{  
   WriteEvent(2, message, prefix);  
}  
```
