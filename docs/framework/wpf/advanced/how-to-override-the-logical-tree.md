# How to: Override the Logical Tree
Although it is not necessary in most cases, advanced control authors have the option to override the logical tree.  
  
## Example  
 This example describes how to subclass <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> to override the logical tree, in this case to enforce a behavior that the panel may only have and will only render a single child element. This isn't necessarily a practically desirable behavior, but is shown here as a means of illustrating the scenario for overriding an element's normal logical tree.  
  
 [!code-csharp[LogicalOverride#SingletonPanel](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LogicalOverride/CSharp/SDKSampleLibrary/class1.cs#singletonpanel)]  
  
 For more information on the logical tree, see [Trees in WPF](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/trees-in-wpf.md).
