# Walkthrough: Hosting a 3-D WPF Composite Control in Windows Forms
This walkthrough demonstrates how you can create a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] composite control and host it in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls and forms by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control.  
  
 In this walkthrough, you will implement a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> that contains two child controls. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> displays a three-dimensional (3-D) cone. Rendering 3-D objects is much easier with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] than with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)]. Therefore, it makes sense to host a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> class to create 3-D graphics in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)].  
  
 Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  
  
-   Creating the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>.  
  
-   Creating the Windows Forms host project.  
  
-   Hosting the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>.  
  
 For a complete code listing of the tasks illustrated in this walkthrough, see [Hosting a 3-D WPF Composite Control in Windows Forms Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160001).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../../../../includes/vs-orcas-long-md.md)].  
  
<a name="To_Create_the_UserControl"></a>   
## Creating the UserControl  
  
#### To create the UserControl  
  
1.  Create a WPF User Control Library project named `HostingWpfUserControlInWf`.  
  
2.  Open UserControl1.xaml in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  
  
3.  Replace the generated code with the following code.  
  
     This code defines a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl?displayProperty=fullName> that contains two child controls. The first child control is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label?displayProperty=fullName> control; the second is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Viewport3D> control that displays a 3-D cone.  
  
     [!code-xaml[HostingWpfUserControlInWf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/CSharp/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/ConeControl.xaml#1)]  
  
<a name="To_Create_the_Windows_Forms_Host_Project"></a>   
## Creating the Windows Forms Host Project  
  
#### To create the host project  
  
1.  Add a Windows application project named `WpfUserControlHost` to the solution. For more information, see [How to: Create a New WPF Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1f6aea7a-33e1-4d3f-8555-1daa42e95d82).  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, add a reference to the WindowsFormsIntegration assembly, which is named WindowsFormsIntegration.dll.  
  
3.  Add references to the following [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] assemblies:  
  
    -   PresentationCore  
  
    -   PresentationFramework  
  
    -   WindowsBase  
  
4.  Add a reference to the `HostingWpfUserControlInWf` project.  
  
5.  In Solution Explorer, set the `WpfUserControlHost` project to be the startup project.  
  
<a name="To_Host_the_Windows_Presentation_Foundation"></a>   
## Hosting the Windows Presentation Foundation UserControl  
  
#### To host the UserControl  
  
1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, open Form1.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, click **Events**, and then double-click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event to create an event handler.  
  
     The Code Editor opens to the newly generated `Form1_Load` event handler.  
  
3.  Replace the code in Form1.cs with the following code.  
  
     The `Form1_Load` event handler creates an instance of `UserControl1` and adds itto the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control's collection of child controls. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control is added to the form's collection of child controls.  
  
     [!code-csharp[HostingWpfUserControlInWf#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/CSharp/WpfUserControlHost/Form1.cs#10)]
     [!code-vb[HostingWpfUserControlInWf#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/VisualBasic/WpfUserControlHost/Form1.vb#10)]  
  
4.  Press F5 to build and run the application.
