# How to: Add an Owner Type for a Dependency Property
This example shows how to add a class as an owner of a dependency property registered for a different type. By doing this, the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] reader and property system are both able to recognize the class as an additional owner of the property. Adding as owner optionally allows the adding class to provide type-specific metadata.  
  
 In the following example, `StateProperty` is a property registered by the `MyStateControl` class. The class `UnrelatedStateControl` adds itself as an owner of the `StateProperty` using the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> method, specifically using the signature that allows for new metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the adding type. Notice that you should provide [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] accessors for the property similar to the example shown in the [Implement a Dependency Property](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-implement-a-dependency-property.md) example, as well as re-expose the dependency property identifier on the class being added as owner.  
  
 Without wrappers, the dependency property would still work from the perspective of programmatic access using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%2A>. But you typically want to parallel this property-system behavior with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-clr-md.md)] property wrappers. The wrappers make it easier to set the dependency property programmatically, and make it possible to set the properties as [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] attributes.  
  
 To find out how to override default metadata, see [Override Metadata for a Dependency Property](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-override-metadata-for-a-dependency-property.md).
