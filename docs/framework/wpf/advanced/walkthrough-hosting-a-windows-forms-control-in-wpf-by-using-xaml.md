# Walkthrough: Hosting a Windows Forms Control in WPF by Using XAML
[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] provides many controls with a rich feature set. However, you may sometimes want to use [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls on your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] pages. For example, you may have a substantial investment in existing [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls, or you may have a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control that provides unique functionality.  
  
 This walkthrough shows you how to host a Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MaskedTextBox?displayProperty=fullName> control on a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] page by using [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)].  
  
 For a complete code listing of the tasks shown in this walkthrough, see [Hosting a Windows Forms Control in WPF by Using XAML Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160000).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)].  
  
## Hosting the Windows Forms Control  
  
#### To host the MaskedTextBox control  
  
1.  Create a WPF Application project named `HostingWfInWpfWithXaml`.  
  
2.  Add references to the following assemblies.  
  
    -   WindowsFormsIntegration  
  
    -   System.Windows.Forms  
  
3.  Open MainWindow.xaml in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  
  
4.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element, add the following namespace mapping. The `wf` namespace mapping establishes a reference to the assembly that contains the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winforms-md.md)] control.  
  
    ```xaml  
    xmlns:wf="clr-namespace:System.Windows.Forms;assembly=System.Windows.Forms"  
    ```  
  
5.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element add the following XAML.  
  
     The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MaskedTextBox> control is created as a child of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control.  
  
     [!code-xaml[HostingWfInWpfWithXaml#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWfInWpfWithXaml/CSharp/HostingWfInWpf/Window1.xaml#3)]  
  
6.  Press F5 to build and run the application.
