# Walkthrough: Hosting an ActiveX Control in WPF
To enable improved interaction with browsers, you can use [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-actx-md.md)] controls in your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]-based application. This walkthrough demonstrates how you can host the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wmp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wmp-md.md)] as a control on a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] page.  
  
 Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  
  
-   Creating the project.  
  
-   Creating the ActiveX control.  
  
-   Hosting the ActiveX control on a WPF Page.  
  
 When you have completed this walkthrough, you will understand how to use [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-actx-md.md)] controls in your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]-based application.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wmp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wmp-md.md)] installed on the computer where [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] is installed.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)].  
  
## Creating the Project  
  
#### To create and set up the project  
  
1.  Create a WPF Application project named `HostingAxInWpf`.  
  
2.  Add a Windows Forms Control Library project to the solution, and name the project `WmpAxLib`.  
  
3.  In the WmpAxLib project, add a reference to the Windows Media Player assembly, which is named wmp.dll.  
  
4.  Open the **Toolbox**.  
  
5.  Right-click in the **Toolbox**, and then click **Choose Items**.  
  
6.  Click the **COM Components** tab, select the **Windows Media Player** control, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The Windows Media Player control is added to the **Toolbox**.  
  
7.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **UserControl1** file, and then click **Rename**.  
  
8.  Change the name to `WmpAxControl.vb` or `WmpAxControl.cs`, depending on the language.  
  
9. If you are prompted to rename all references, click **Yes**.  
  
## Creating the ActiveX Control  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)] automatically generates an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AxHost> wrapper class for a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-actx-md.md)] control when the control is added to a design surface. The following procedure creates a managed assembly named AxInterop.WMPLib.dll.  
  
#### To create the ActiveX control  
  
1.  Open WmpAxControl.vb or WmpAxControl.cs in the Windows Forms Designer.  
  
2.  From the **Toolbox**, add the Windows Media Player control to the design surface.  
  
3.  In the Properties window, set the value of the Windows Media Player control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill>.  
  
4.  Build the WmpAxLib control library project.  
  
## Hosting the ActiveX Control on a WPF Page  
  
#### To host the ActiveX control  
  
1.  In the HostingAxInWpf project, add a reference to the generated [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-actx-md.md)] interoperability assembly.  
  
     This assembly is named AxInterop.WMPLib.dll and was added to the Debug folder of the WmpAxLib project when you imported the Windows Media Player control.  
  
2.  Add a reference to the WindowsFormsIntegration assembly, which is named WindowsFormsIntegration.dll.  
  
3.  Add a reference to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] assembly, which is named System.Windows.Forms.dll.  
  
4.  Open MainWindow.xaml in the WPF Designer.  
  
5.  Name the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element `grid1`.  
  
     [!code-xaml[HostingAxInWpf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingAxInWpf/CSharp/HostingAxInWpf/window1.xaml#1)]  
  
6.  In Design view or XAML view, select the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element.  
  
7.  In the Properties window, click the **Events** tab.  
  
8.  Double-click the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.  
  
9. Insert the following code to handle the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.  
  
     This code creates an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control and adds an instance of the `AxWindowsMediaPlayer` control as its child.  
  
     [!code-csharp[HostingAxInWpf#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingAxInWpf/CSharp/HostingAxInWpf/window1.xaml.cs#11)]
     [!code-vb[HostingAxInWpf#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingAxInWpf/VisualBasic/HostingAxInWpf/window1.xaml.vb#11)]  
  
10. Press F5 to build and run the application.
