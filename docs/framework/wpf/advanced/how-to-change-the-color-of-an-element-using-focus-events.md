# How to: Change the Color of an Element Using Focus Events
This example shows how to change the color of an element when it gains and loses focus by using the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotFocus> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.LostFocus> events.  
  
 This example consists of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file and a code-behind file.  
  
## Example  
 The following [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_titlexaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] creates the user interface, which consists of two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> objects, and attaches event handlers for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotFocus> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.LostFocus> events to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> objects.  
  
 [!code-xaml[gotfocusLostfocusEffectUsingEvent#GotLostFocusSampleXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gotfocusLostfocusEffectUsingEvent/CSharp/Window1.xaml#gotlostfocussamplexaml)]  
  
 The following code behind creates the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.GotFocus> and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.LostFocus> event handlers.  When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> gains keyboard focus, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is changed to red.  When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> loses keyboard focus, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is changed back to white.
