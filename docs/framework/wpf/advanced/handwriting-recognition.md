# Handwriting Recognition
This section discusses the fundamentals of recognition as it pertains to digital ink in the WPF platform.  
  
## Recognition Solutions  
 The following example shows how to recognize ink using the [Microsoft.Ink.InkCollector](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.ink.inkcollector\(v=vs.90\).aspx) class.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This sample requires that handwriting recognizers be installed on the system.  
  
 Create a new WPF application project in Visual Studio called **InkRecognition**. Replace the contents of the Window1.xaml file with the following XAML code. This code renders the application's user interface.  
  
 [!code-xaml[InkRecognition#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkRecognition/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  
  
 Add a reference to the Microsoft Ink assembly, Microsoft.Ink.dll, which can be found in \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Ink. Replace the contents of the code behind file with the following code.  
  
 [!code-csharp[InkRecognition#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkRecognition/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#2)]
 [!code-vb[InkRecognition#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkRecognition/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#2)]
