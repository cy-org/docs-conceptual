# Migration and Interoperability
This page contains links to documents that discuss how to implement interoperation between [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications and other types of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-win-md.md)] applications.

|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>|An element that you can use to host a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control as an element of a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] page.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>|A [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control that you can use to host a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] control.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource>|Hosts a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] region within a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] application.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost>|Base class for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>, defines some basic functionality that all HWND-based technologies use when hosted by a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application.
