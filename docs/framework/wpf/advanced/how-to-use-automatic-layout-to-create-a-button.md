# How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button
This example describes how to use the automatic layout approach to create a button in a localizable application.  
  
 Localization of a              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] can be a time consuming process. Often localizers need to resize and reposition elements in addition to translating text. In the past each language that a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment. Now with the capabilities of              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called              `automatic layout`.  
  
 The following two              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] examples create applications that instantiate a button; one with English text and one with Spanish text. Notice that the code is the same except for the text; the button adjusts to fit the text.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-xaml[LocalizationBtn_snip#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn_snip/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  
  
 [!code-xaml[LocalizationBtn#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  
  
 The following graphic shows the output of the code samples.
