# How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically
This example shows how to programmatically change the              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FlowDirection%2A> property of a              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader>.  
  
## Example  
 Two                      <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements are created, each representing one of the possible values of                      <xref:System.Windows.FlowDirection>. When a button is clicked, the associated property value is applied to the contents of a                      <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader> named                      `tf1`.  The property value is also written to a                      <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> named                      `txt1`.

## Example  
 The events associated with the button clicks defined above are handled in a                      [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_cshrp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-cshrp-md.md)] code-behind file.
