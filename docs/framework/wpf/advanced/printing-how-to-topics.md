# Printing How-to Topics
The topics in this section demonstrate how to use the printing and print system management features included with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] as well as the new [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xps](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xps-md.md)] print path.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Invoke a Print Dialog](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-invoke-a-print-dialog.md)  
 Instructions for XAML markup to declare a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-win-md.md)] print dialog object and using code to invoke the dialog from within a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] application.  
  
 [Clone a Printer](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-clone-a-printer.md)  
 Instructions for how to install a second print queue with exactly the same properties as an existing print queue.  
  
 [Diagnose Problematic Print Job](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-diagnose-problematic-print-job.md)  
 Instructions for using the properties of print queues and print jobs to diagnose a print job that is not printing.  
  
 [Discover Whether a Print Job Can Be Printed At This Time of Day](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-discover-whether-a-print-job-can-be-printed-at-this-time-of-day.md)  
 Instructions for using the properties of print queues and print jobs to programmatically what times of day the job can be printed.  
  
 [Enumerate a Subset of Print Queues](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-enumerate-a-subset-of-print-queues.md)  
 Instructions for generating a list of printers having certain characteristics.

 Extended discussion of how managed code programmers can extend the Print Schema to specialty printing devices or printers with new or uncommon features.  
  
 [Get Print System Object Properties Without Reflection](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-get-print-system-object-properties-without-reflection.md)  
 Instructions for how to discover at runtime print system object's properties and their types.

 Instructions for rapid printing of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xps](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xps-md.md)] files without the need for a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)].  
  
 [Remotely Survey the Status of Printers](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-remotely-survey-the-status-of-printers.md)  
 Instructions for creating a utility that will survey printers to discover those experience a paper jam or other problem.  
  
 [Validate and Merge PrintTickets](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-validate-and-merge-printtickets.md)
