# How to: Use Special Characters in XAML
Markup files that are created in              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)] are automatically saved in the              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_unicode](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-unicode-md.md)] UTF-8 file format, which means that most special characters, such as accent marks, are encoded correctly. However, there is a set of commonly-used special characters that are handled differently. These special characters follow the              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_w3c](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-w3c-md.md)][!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xml-md.md)] standard for encoding.  
  
 The following table shows the syntax for encoding this set of special characters:  
  
|Character|Syntax|Description|  
|---------------|------------|-----------------|  
|<|`<`|Less than symbol.|  
|>|`>`|Greater than sign.|  
|&|`&`|Ampersand symbol.|  
|"|`"`|Double quote symbol.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you create a markup file using a text editor, such as                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] Notepad, you must save the file in the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_unicode](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-unicode-md.md)] UTF-8 file format in order to preserve any encoded special characters.  
  
 The following example shows how you can use special characters in text when creating markup.
