# Collecting Ink
The [Windows Presentation Foundation](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/index.md) platform collects digital ink as a core part of its functionality. This topic discusses methods for collection of ink in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)].  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To use the following examples, you must first install [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu2005](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu2005-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)]. You should also understand how to write applications for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For more information about getting started with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], see [Walkthrough: My first WPF desktop application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application.md).  
  
## Using the InkCanvas Element  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> element provides the easiest way to collect ink in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> element is similar to the [Microsoft.Ink.InkOverlay](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.ink.inkoverlay\(v=vs.90\).aspx) object from the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_tpclssdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-tpclssdk-md.md)] and earlier versions.  
  
 Use an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> element to receive and display ink input. You commonly input ink through the use of a stylus, which interacts with a digitizer to produce ink strokes. In addition, a mouse can be used in place of a stylus. The created strokes are represented as <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke> objects, and they can be manipulated both programmatically and by user input. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> enables users to select, modify, or delete an existing <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke>.  
  
 By using XAML, you can set up ink collection as easily as adding an `InkCanvas` element to your tree. The following example adds an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> to a default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] project created in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu2005](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu2005-md.md)].  
  
 [!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#6)]  
  
 The `InkCanvas` element can also contain child elements, making it possible to add ink annotation capabilities to almost any type of XAML element. For example, to add inking capabilities to a text element, simply make it a child of an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>.  
  
 [!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#5)]  
  
 Adding support for marking up an image with ink is just as easy.  
  
 [!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#7)]  
  
### InkCollection Modes  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> provides support for various input modes through its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.EditingMode%2A> property.  
  
### Manipulating Ink  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> provides support for many ink editing operations. For example, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> supports back-of-pen erase with no additional code needed to add the functionality to the element.  
  
#### Selection  
 Setting selection mode is as simple as setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvasEditingMode> property to **Select**. The following code sets the editing mode based on the value of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox>:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DigitalInkTopics#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#8)]
 [!code-vb[DigitalInkTopics#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#8)]  
  
#### DrawingAttributes  
 Use the <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke.DrawingAttributes%2A> property to change the appearance of ink strokes. For instance, the <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes.Color%2A> member of <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes> sets the color of the rendered <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke>. The following example changes the color of the selected strokes to red.  
  
 [!code-csharp[DigitalInkTopics#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#9)]
 [!code-vb[DigitalInkTopics#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#9)]  
  
### DefaultDrawingAttributes  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> property provides access to properties such as the height, width, and color of the strokes to be created in an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>. Once you change the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A>, all future strokes entered into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> are rendered with the new property values.  
  
 In addition to modifying the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> in the code-behind file, you can use XAML syntax for specifying <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> properties. The following XAML code demonstrates how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes.Color%2A> property. To use this code, create a new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] project called "HelloInkCanvas" in Visual Studio 2005. Replace the code in the Window1.xaml file with the following code.  
  
 [!code-xaml[HelloInkCanvas#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HelloInkCanvas/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  
  
 Next, add the following button event handlers to the code behind file, inside the Window1 class.  
  
 [!code-csharp[HelloInkCanvas#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HelloInkCanvas/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#2)]  
  
 After copying this code, press **F5** in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 to run the program in the debugger.  
  
 Notice how the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> places the buttons on top of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>. If you try to ink over the top of the buttons, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> collects and renders the ink behind the buttons. This is because the buttons are siblings of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> as opposed to children. Also, the buttons are higher in the z-order, so the ink is rendered behind them.
