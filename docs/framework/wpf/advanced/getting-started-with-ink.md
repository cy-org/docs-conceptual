# Getting Started with Ink
Incorporating digital ink into your applications is easier than ever. Ink has evolved from being a corollary to the COM and Windows Forms method of programming to achieving full integration into the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. You do not need to install separate SDKs or runtime libraries.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To use the following examples, you must first install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)]. You should also understand how to write applications for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For more information about getting started with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], see [Walkthrough: My first WPF desktop application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application.md).  
  
## Quick Start  
 This section helps you write a simple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application that collects ink.  
  
 If you haven't already done so, install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications usually must be compiled before you can view them, even if they consist entirely of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. However, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)] includes an application, XamlPad, designed to speed up the process of implementing a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]-based UI. You can use that application to view and tinker with the first few samples in this document. The process of creating compiled applications from [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] is covered later in this document.  
  
 To launch XAMLPad, click the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Winndows SDK**, point to **Tools**, and click **XAMLPad**. In the rendering pane, XAMLPad renders the XAML code written in the code pane. You can edit the XAML code, and the changes immediately appear in the rendering pane.  
  
#### Got Ink?  
 To start your first [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application that supports ink:  
  
1.  Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2005  
  
2.  Create a new **Windows Application (WPF)**  
  
3.  Type `<InkCanvas/>` between the `<Grid>` tags  
  
4.  Press **F5** to launch your application in the debugger  
  
5.  Using a stylus or mouse, write **hello world** in the window  
  
 You've written the ink equivalent of a "hello world" application with only 12 keystrokes!  
  
#### Spice Up Your Application  
 Let’s take advantage of some features of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].  Replace everything between the opening \<Window> and closing \</Window> tags with the following markup to get a gradient brush background on your inking surface.  
  
 [!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  
[!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#1a](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1a)]  
  
#### Using Animation  
 For fun, let's animate the colors of the gradient brush. Add the following [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] after the closing `</InkCanvas>` tag but before the closing `</Page>` tag.  
  
 [!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml#2)]  
  
#### Adding Some Code Behind the XAML  
 While XAML makes it very easy to design the user interface, any real-world application needs to add code to handle events. Here is a simple example that zooms in on the ink in response to a right-click from a mouse:  
  
 Set the `MouseRightButtonUp` handler in your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]:  
  
 [!code-xaml[DigitalInkTopics#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#3)]  
  
 In Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, expand Windows1.xaml and open the code-behind file, Window1.xaml.cs or Window1.xaml.vb if you are using Visual Basic. Add the following event handler code:  
  
 [!code-csharp[DigitalInkTopics#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml.cs#4)]
 [!code-vb[DigitalInkTopics#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/VisualBasic/Window2.xaml.vb#4)]  
  
 Now, run your application. Add some ink and then right-click with the mouse or perform a press-and-hold equivalent with a stylus.  
  
#### Using Procedural Code Instead of XAML  
 You can access all [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] features from procedural code. Here is a "Hello Ink World" application for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] that doesn’t use any [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] at all. Paste the code below into an empty Console Application in Visual Studio. Add references to the PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, and WindowsBase assemblies, and build the application by pressing **F5**:  
  
 [!code-csharp[InkCanvasConsoleApp#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkCanvasConsoleApp/CSharp/Program.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[InkCanvasConsoleApp#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkCanvasConsoleApp/VisualBasic/Module1.vb#1)]
