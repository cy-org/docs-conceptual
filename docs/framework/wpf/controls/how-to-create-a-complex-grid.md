# How to: Create a Complex Grid
This example shows how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> to create layout that looks like a monthly calendar.  
  
## Example  
 The following example defines eight rows and eight columns by using the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition> classes. It uses the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.RowSpan%2A?displayProperty=fullName> attached properties, together with <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle> elements, which fill the backgrounds of various columns and rows. This design is possible because more than one element can exist in each cell in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, a principle difference between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> and <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table>.  
  
 The example uses vertical gradients to <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> the columns and rows in order to improve the visual presentation and readability of the calendar. Styled <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements represent the dates and days of the week. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements are absolutely positioned within their cells by using the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property and alignment properties that are defined within the style for the application.
