# How to: Create a Grid Element
## Example  
 The following example shows how to create and use an instance of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> by using either [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] or code. This example uses three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition> objects and three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition> objects to create a grid that has nine cells, such as in a worksheet. Each cell contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element that represents data, and the top row contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> property applied. To show the boundaries of each cell, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ShowGridLines%2A> property is enabled.
