# How to: Make Sure That a GridSplitter Is Visible
This example shows how to make sure a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> control is not hidden by the other controls in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.  
  
## Example  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> control are rendered in the order that they are defined in markup or code. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> controls can be hidden by other controls if you do not define them as the last elements in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> collection or if you give other controls a higher <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndexProperty>.  
  
 To prevent hidden <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> controls, do one of the following.  
  
-   Make sure that <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> controls are the last <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> added to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>. The following example shows the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> as the last element in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> collection of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.  
  
 [!code-xaml[GridSplitterSnips#GridSplitterLastChild](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterSnips/CSharp/Window1.xaml#gridsplitterlastchild)]  
  
-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndexProperty> on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> to be higher than a control that would otherwise hide it. The following example gives the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> control a higher <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndexProperty> than the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control.  
  
 [!code-xaml[GridSplitterSnips#GridSplitterZIndex](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterSnips/CSharp/Window1.xaml#gridsplitterzindex)]  
  
-   Set margins on the control that would otherwise hide the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> so that the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> is exposed. The following example sets margins on a control that would otherwise overlay and hide the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>.
