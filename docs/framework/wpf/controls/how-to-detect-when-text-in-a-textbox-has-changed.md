# How to: Detect When Text in a TextBox Has Changed
This example shows one way to use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> event to execute a method whenever the text in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control has changed.  
  
 In the code-behind class for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] that contains the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control that you want to monitor for changes, insert a method to call whenever the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> event fires.  This method must have a signature that matches what is expected by the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextChangedEventHandler> delegate.  
  
 The event handler is called whenever the contents of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control are changed, either by a user or programmatically.  
  
 **Note:** This event fires when the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control is created and initially populated with text.  
  
## Example  
 In the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] that defines your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control, specify the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> attribute with a value that matches the event handler method name.
