# How to: Configure IIS 5.0 and IIS 6.0 to Deploy WPF Applications
You can deploy a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] application from most Web servers, as long as they are configured with the appropriate [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mime-md.md)] types. By default, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis70](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis70-md.md)] is configured with these [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types, but [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] are not.  
  
 This topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] to deploy [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications.  
  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can check the *UserAgent* string in the registry to determine whether a system has [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] installed. For details and a script that examines the *UserAgent* string to determine whether [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] is installed on a system, see [Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.0 Is Installed](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-0-is-installed.md).  
  
<a name="content_expiration"></a>   
## Adjust the Content Expiration Setting  
 You should adjust the content expiration setting to 1 minute. The following procedure outlines how to do this with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)].  
  
1.  Click the **Start** menu, point to **Administrative Tools**, and click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**. You can also launch this application from the command line with "%SystemRoot%\system32\inetsrv\iis.msc".  
  
2.  Expand the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)] tree until you find the **Default Web site** node.  
  
3.  Right-click **Default Web site** and select **Properties** from the context menu.  
  
4.  Select the **HTTP Headers** tab and click "Enable Content Expiration".  
  
5.  Set the content to expire after 1 minute.  
  
<a name="register_mime_types"></a>   
## Register MIME Types and File Extensions  
 You must register several [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types and file extensions so that the browser on the client's system can load the correct handler. You need to add the following types:  
  
|Extension|MIME Type|  
|---------------|---------------|  
|.manifest|application/manifest|  
|.xaml|application/xaml+xml|  
|.application|application/x-ms-application|  
|.xbap|application/x-ms-xbap|  
|.deploy|application/octet-stream|  
|.xps|application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You do not need to register [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types or file extensions on client systems. They are registered automatically when you install [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winfx](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winfx-md.md)].  
  
 The following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualbscrpt](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualbscrpt-md.md)] sample automatically adds the necessary [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)]. To use the script, copy the code to a .vbs file on your server. Then, run the script by running the file from the command line or double-clicking the file in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winexpl](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winexpl-md.md)].  
  
```  
      ' This script adds the necessary Windows Presentation Foundation MIME types   
' to an IIS Server.  
' To use this script, just double-click or execute it from a command line.  
' Running this script multiple times results in multiple entries in the IIS MimeMap.  
  
Dim MimeMapObj, MimeMapArray, MimeTypesToAddArray, WshShell, oExec  
Const ADS_PROPERTY_UPDATE = 2   
  
' Set the MIME types to be added  
MimeTypesToAddArray = Array(".manifest", "application/manifest", ".xaml", _  
    "application/xaml+xml", ".application", "application/x-ms-application", _  
    ".deploy", "application/octet-stream", ".xbap", "application/x-ms-xbap", _  
    ".xps", "application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument")   
  
' Get the mimemap object   
Set MimeMapObj = GetObject("IIS://LocalHost/MimeMap")  
  
' Call AddMimeType for every pair of extension/MIME type  
For counter = 0 to UBound(MimeTypesToAddArray) Step 2  
    AddMimeType MimeTypesToAddArray(counter), MimeTypesToAddArray(counter+1)  
Next  
  
' Create a Shell object  
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")  
  
' Stop and Start the IIS Service  
Set oExec = WshShell.Exec("net stop w3svc")  
Do While oExec.Status = 0  
    WScript.Sleep 100  
Loop  
  
Set oExec = WshShell.Exec("net start w3svc")  
Do While oExec.Status = 0  
    WScript.Sleep 100  
Loop  
  
Set oExec = Nothing  
  
' Report status to user  
WScript.Echo "Windows Presentation Foundation MIME types have been registered."  
  
' AddMimeType Sub  
Sub AddMimeType (Ext, MType)  
  
    ' Get the mappings from the MimeMap property.   
    MimeMapArray = MimeMapObj.GetEx("MimeMap")   
  
    ' Add a new mapping.   
    i = UBound(MimeMapArray) + 1   
    Redim Preserve MimeMapArray(i)   
    Set MimeMapArray(i) = CreateObject("MimeMap")   
    MimeMapArray(i).Extension = Ext   
    MimeMapArray(i).MimeType = MType   
    MimeMapObj.PutEx ADS_PROPERTY_UPDATE, "MimeMap", MimeMapArray  
    MimeMapObj.SetInfo  
  
End Sub  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Running this script multiple times creates multiple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] map entries in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] metabase.  
  
 After you have run this script, you may not see additional [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types from the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mmc](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mmc-md.md)]. However, these [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types have been added to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] metabase. The following script will display all the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] metabase.  
  
```  
' This script lists the MIME types for an IIS Server.  
' To use this script, just double-click or execute it from a command line   
' by calling cscript.exe  
  
dim mimeMapEntry, allMimeMaps  
  
' Get the mimemap object.  
Set mimeMapEntry = GetObject("IIS://localhost/MimeMap")  
allMimeMaps = mimeMapEntry.GetEx("MimeMap")  
  
' Display the mappings in the table.  
For Each mimeMap In allMimeMaps  
    WScript.Echo(mimeMap.MimeType & " (" & mimeMap.Extension + ")")  
Next  
```  
  
 Save the script as a `.vbs` file (for example, `DiscoverIISMimeTypes.vbs`) and run it from the command prompt using the following command:  
  
 `cscript DiscoverIISMimeTypes.vbs`
