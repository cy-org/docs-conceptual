# IEnumRAWINPUTDEVIC:Clone
Creates another raw input device enumerator with the same state as the current enumerator to iterate over the same list.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Clone( [out] IEnumRAWINPUTDEVICE **ppenum);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `ppenum`  
  
 [out] Address of output variable that receives the [IEnumRAWINPUTDEVICE](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/ienumrawinputdevice.md) interface pointer. If the method is unsuccessful, the value of this output variable is undefined.  
  
## Property Value/Return Value  
 HRESULT: This method supports the standard return values E_INVALIDARG, E_OUTOFMEMORY, and E_UNEXPECTED.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method makes it possible to record a point in the enumeration sequence in order to return to that point at a later time. The caller must release this new enumerator separately from the first enumerator.
