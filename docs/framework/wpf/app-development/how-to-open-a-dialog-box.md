# How to: Open a Dialog Box
This example shows how to open a dialog box.  
  
## Example  
 A dialog box is a window that is opened by instantiating <xref:System.Windows.Window> and calling the <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowDialog%2A> method. <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowDialog%2A> opens a window and doesn't return until the new dialog box has been closed. This type of window is also known as a *modal* window, and restricts user input.

 [!code-vb[HOWTOWindowManagementSnippets#OpenNewDialogBoxCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTOWindowManagementSnippets/visualbasic/mainwindow.xaml.vb#opennewdialogboxcode)]  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 Calling <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowDialog%2A> requires permission to use all windows and user input events without restriction.
