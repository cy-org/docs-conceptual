# How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed
The [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] plug-in for Firefox enables [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] and loose XAML files to run in the Mozilla Firefox browser. This topic provides a script written in HTML and JavaScript that administrators can use to determine whether the WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For more information about installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md).  
  
## Example  
 When the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, the client computer is configured with a WPF plug-in for Firefox. The following example script checks for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and then displays an appropriate status message.  
  
```  
<HTML>  
  
  <HEAD>  
    <TITLE>Test for the WPF plug-in for Firefox</TITLE>  
    <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=utf-8" />  
    <SCRIPT type="text/javascript">  
    <!--  
    function OnLoad()  
    {  
  
       // Check for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and report  
       var msg = "The WPF plug-in for Firefox is ";  
       var wpfPlugin = navigator.plugins["Windows Presentation Foundation"];  
       if( wpfPlugin != null ) {  
          document.writeln(msg + " installed.");  
       }  
       else {  
          document.writeln(msg + " not installed. Please install or reinstall the .NET Framework 3.5.");  
       }  
    }  
    -->  
    </SCRIPT>  
  </HEAD>  
  
  <BODY onload="OnLoad()" />  
  
</HTML>  
```  
  
 If the check for the WPF plug-in for Firefox is successful, the following status message is displayed:  
  
 `The WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed.`  
  
 Otherwise, the following status message is displayed:  
  
 `The WPF plug-in for Firefox is not installed. Please install or reinstall the .NET Framework 3.5.`
