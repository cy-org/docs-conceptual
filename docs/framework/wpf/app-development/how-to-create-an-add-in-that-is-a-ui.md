# How to: Create an Add-In That Is a UI
This example shows how to create an add-in that is a              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)][!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] which is hosted by a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] standalone application.  
  
 The add-in is a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that is a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] user control. The content of the user control is a single button that, when clicked, displays a message box. The              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] standalone application hosts the add-in              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] as the content of the main application window.  
  
 **Prerequisites**  
  
 This example highlights the              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extensions to the              [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model that enable this scenario, and assumes the following:  
  
-   Knowledge of the                      [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model, including pipeline, add-in, and host development. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, see                      [Add-ins and Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/add-ins/index.md). For a tutorial that demonstrates the implementation of a pipeline, an add-in, and a host application, see                      [Walkthrough: Creating an Extensible Application](../../../../docs/framework/add-ins/walkthrough-create-extensible-app.md).  
  
-   Knowledge of the                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extensions to the                      [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model, which can be found here:                      [WPF Add-Ins Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/wpf-add-ins-overview.md).  
  
## Example  
 To create an add-in that is a                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)][!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] requires specific code for each pipeline segment, the add-in, and the host application.  
    
  
<a name="Contract"></a>   
## Implementing the Contract Pipeline Segment  
 When an add-in is a                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], the contract for the add-in must implement                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>. In the example,                              `IWPFAddInContract` implements                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, as shown in the following code.  
  
 [!code-csharp[SimpleAddInIsAUISample#ContractCode](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleAddInIsAUISample/CSharp/Contracts/IWPFAddInContract.cs#contractcode)]  
  
<a name="AddInViewPipeline"></a>   
## Implementing the Add-In View Pipeline Segment  
 Because the add-in is implemented as a subclass of the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> type, the add-in view must also subclass                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>. The following code shows the add-in view of the contract, implemented as the                              `WPFAddInView` class.  
  
 [!code-csharp[SimpleAddInIsAUISample#AddInViewCode](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleAddInIsAUISample/CSharp/AddInViews/WPFAddInView.cs#addinviewcode)]  
  
 Here, the add-in view is derived from                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>. Consequently, the add-in                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] should also derive from                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>.  
  
<a name="AddInSideAdapter"></a>   
## Implementing the Add-In-Side Adapter Pipeline Segment  
 While the contract is an                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, the add-in is a                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> (as specified by the add-in view pipeline segment). Therefore, the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> must be converted to an                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> before crossing the isolation boundary. This work is performed by the add-in-side adapter by calling                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A>, as shown in the following code.  
  
 [!code-csharp[SimpleAddInIsAUISample#AddInSideAdapterCode](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleAddInIsAUISample/CSharp/AddInSideAdapters/WPFAddIn_ViewToContractAddInSideAdapter.cs#addinsideadaptercode)]  
  
 In the add-in model where an add-in returns a                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] (see                              [Create an Add-In That Returns a UI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/how-to-create-an-add-in-that-returns-a-ui.md)), the add-in adapter converted the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> to an                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> by calling                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A>.                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> must also be called in this model, although you need to implement a method from which to write the code to call it. You do this by overriding                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> and implementing the code that calls                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> if the code that is calling                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> is expecting an                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>. In this case, the caller will be the host-side adapter, which is covered in a subsequent subsection.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You also need to override                                  <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> in this model to enable tabbing between host application                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] and add-in                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]. For more information, see "WPF Add-In Limitations" in                                  [WPF Add-Ins Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/wpf-add-ins-overview.md).  
  
 Because the add-in-side adapter implements an interface that derives from                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, you also need to implement                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract.GetHandle%2A>, although this is ignored when                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> is overridden.  
  
<a name="HostViewPipeline"></a>   
## Implementing the Host View Pipeline Segment  
 In this model, the host application typically expects the host view to be a                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> subclass. The host-side adapter must convert the                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> to a                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> after the                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> crosses the isolation boundary. Because a method isn't being called by the host application to get the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, the host view must "return" the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> by containing it. Consequently, the host view must derive from a subclass of                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> that can contain other                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)], such as                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>. The following code shows the host view of the contract, implemented as the                              `WPFAddInHostView` class.  
  
  
  
<a name="HostSideAdapter"></a>   
## Implementing the Host-Side Adapter Pipeline Segment  
 While the contract is an                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, the host application expects a                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> (as specified by the host view). Consequently, the                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> must be converted to a                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> after crossing the isolation boundary, before being set as content of the host view (which derives from                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>).  
  
 This work is performed by the host-side adapter, as shown in the following code.  
  
  
  
 As you can see, the host-side adapter acquires the                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> by calling the add-in-side adapter's                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> method (this is the point where the                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> crosses the isolation boundary).  
  
 The host-side adapter then converts the                              <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> to a                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> by calling                              <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A>. Finally, the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> is set as the content of the host view.  
  
<a name="AddIn"></a>   
## Implementing the Add-In  
 With the add-in-side adapter and add-in view in place, the add-in can be implemented by deriving from the add-in view, as shown in the following code.  
  
  
  
  
  
 From this example, you can see one interesting benefit of this model: add-in developers only need to implement the add-in (since it is the                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] as well), rather than both an add-in class and an add-in                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)].  
  
<a name="HostApp"></a>   
## Implementing the Host Application  
 With the host-side adapter and host view created, the host application can use the                              [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model to open the pipeline and acquire a host view of the add-in. These steps are shown in the following code.  
  
  
  
 The host application uses typical                              [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model code to activate the add-in, which implicitly returns the host view to the host application. The host application subsequently displays the host view (which is a                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>) from a                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.  
  
 The code for processing interactions with the add-in                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] runs in the add-in's application domain. These interactions include the following:  
  
-   Handling the                                      <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button><xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event.  
  
-   Showing the                                      <xref:System.Windows.MessageBox>.  
  
 This activity is completely isolated from the host application.
