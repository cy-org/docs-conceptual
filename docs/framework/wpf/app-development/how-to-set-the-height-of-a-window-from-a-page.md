# How to: Set the Height of a Window from a Page
This example illustrates how to set the height of the window from a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>.  
  
## Example  
 A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> can set the height of its host window by setting <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.WindowHeight%2A>. This property allows the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> to not have explicit knowledge of the type of window that hosts it.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To set the height of a window using <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.WindowHeight%2A>, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> must be the child of a window.
