# WPF Add-Ins Overview
<a name="Introduction"></a> The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] includes an add-in model that developers can use to create applications that support add-in extensibility. This add-in model allows the creation of add-ins that integrate with and extend application functionality. In some scenarios, applications also need to display [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] that are provided by add-ins. This topic shows how [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] augments the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model to enable these scenarios, the architecture behind it, its benefits, and its limitations.  
  

  
<a name="Requirements"></a>   
## Prerequisites  
 Familiarity with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model is required. For more information, see [Add-ins and Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/add-ins/index.md).  
  
<a name="AddInsOverview"></a>   
## Add-Ins Overview  
 In order to avoid the complexities of application recompilation and redeployment to incorporate new functionality, applications implement extensibility mechanisms that allow developers (both first-party and third-party) to create other applications that integrate with them. The most common way to support this type of extensibility is through the use of add-ins (also known as "add-ons" and "plug-ins"). Examples of real-world applications that expose extensibility with add-ins include:  
  
-   Internet Explorer add-ons.  
  
-   Windows Media Player plug-ins.  
  
-   Visual Studio add-ins.  
  
 For example, the Windows Media Player add-in model allows third-party developers to implement "plug-ins" that extend Windows Media Player in a variety of ways, including creating decoders and encoders for media formats that are not supported natively by Windows Media Player (for example, DVD, MP3), audio effects, and skins. Each add-in model is built to expose the functionality that is unique to an application, although there are several entities and behaviors that are common to all add-in models.  
  
 The three main entities of typical add-in extensibility solutions are *contracts*, *add-ins*, and *host applications*. Contracts define how add-ins integrate with host applications in two ways:  
  
-   Add-ins integrate with functionality that is implemented by host applications.  
  
-   Host applications expose functionality for add-ins to integrate with.  
  
 In order for add-ins to be used, host applications need to find them and load them at run time. Consequently, applications that support add-ins have the following additional responsibilities:  
  
-   **Discovery**: Finding add-ins that adhere to contracts supported by host applications.  
  
-   **Activation**: Loading, running, and establishing communication with add-ins.  
  
-   **Isolation**: Using either application domains or processes to establish isolation boundaries that protect applications from potential security and execution problems with add-ins.  
  
-   **Communication**: Allowing add-ins and host applications to communicate with each other across isolation boundaries by calling methods and passing data.  
  
-   **Lifetime Management**: Loading and unloading application domains and processes in a clean, predictable manner (see [Application Domains](../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/application-domains.md)).  
  
-   **Versioning**: Ensuring that host applications and add-ins can still communicate when new versions of either are created.  
  
 Ultimately, developing a robust add-in model is a non-trivial undertaking. For this reason, the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] provides an infrastructure for building add-in models.

<a name="NETFrameworkAddInModelOverview"></a>   
## .NET Framework Add-In Model Overview  
 The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model, found in the <xref:System.AddIn> namespace, contains a set of types that are designed to simplify the development of add-in extensibility. The fundamental unit of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model is the *contract*, which defines how a host application and an add-in communicate with each other. A contract is exposed to a host application using a host-application-specific *view* of the contract. Likewise, an add-in-specific *view* of the contract is exposed to the add-in. An *adapter* is used to allow a host application and an add-in to communicate between their respective views of the contract. Contracts, views, and adapters are referred to as segments, and a set of related segments constitutes a *pipeline*. Pipelines are the foundation upon which the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model supports discovery, activation, security isolation, execution isolation (using both application domains and processes), communication, lifetime management, and versioning.  
  
 The sum of this support allows developers to build add-ins that integrate with the functionality of a host application. However, some scenarios require host applications to display [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] provided by add-ins. Because each presentation technology in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] has its own model for implementing [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model does not support any particular presentation technology. Instead, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extends the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] support for add-ins.  
  
<a name="WPFAddInModel"></a>   
## WPF Add-Ins  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], in conjunction with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model, allows you to address a wide variety of scenarios that require host applications to display [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] from add-ins. In particular, these scenarios are addressed by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] with the following two programming models:  
  
1.  **The add-in returns a UI**. An add-in returns a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to the host application via a method call, as defined by the contract. This scenario is used in the following cases:  
  
    -   The appearance of a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that is returned by an add-in is dependent on either data or conditions that exist only at run time, such as dynamically generated reports.  
  
    -   The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] for services provided by an add-in differs from the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] of the host applications that can use the add-in.  
  
    -   The add-in primarily performs a service for the host application, and reports status to the host application with a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)].  
  
2.  **The add-in is a UI**. An add-in is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], as defined by the contract. This scenario is used in the following cases:  
  
    -   An add-in doesn't provide services other than being displayed, such as an advertisement.  
  
    -   The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] for services provided by an add-in is common to all host applications that can use that add-in, such as a calculator or color picker.  
  
 These scenarios require that [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] objects can be passed between host application and add-in application domains. Since the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model relies on remoting to communicate between application domains, the objects that are passed between them must be remotable.  
  
 A remotable object is an instance of a class that does one or more of the following:  
  
-   Derives from the <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject> class.  
  
-   Implements the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> interface.  
  
-   Has the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> attribute applied.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For more information regarding the creation of remotable [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] objects, see [Making Objects Remotable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/01197253-3f13-43b7-894d-9683e431192a).  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] types are not remotable. To solve the problem, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extends the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model to enable [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] created by add-ins to be displayed from host applications. This support is provided by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] by two types: the <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> interface and two static methods implemented by the <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters> class: <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A> and <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A>. At a high level, these types and methods are used in the following manner:  
  
1.  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] requires that [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] provided by add-ins are classes that derive directly or indirectly from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, such as shapes, controls, user controls, layout panels, and pages.  
  
2.  Wherever the contract declares that a UI will be passed between the add-in and the host application, it must be declared as an <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> (not a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>); <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> is a remotable representation of the add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that can be passed across isolation boundaries.  
  
3.  Before being passed from the add-in's application domain, a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> is packaged as an <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> by calling <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A>.  
  
4.  After being passed to the host application's application domain, the <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> must be repackaged as a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> by calling <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A>.  
  
 How <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A>, and <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> are used depends on the specific scenario. The following sections provide details for each programming model.  
  
<a name="ReturnUIFromAddInContract"></a>   
## Add-In Returns a User Interface  
 For an add-in to return a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to a host application, the following are required:  
  
1.  The host application, add-in, and pipeline must be created, as described by the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] [Add-ins and Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/add-ins/index.md) documentation.  
  
2.  The contract must implement <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.IContract> and, to return a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], the contract must declare a method with a return value of type <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>.  
  
3.  The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that is passed between the add-in and the host application must directly or indirectly derive from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>.  
  
4.  The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that is returned by the add-in must be converted from a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> to an <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> before crossing the isolation boundary.  
  
5.  The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that is returned must be converted from an <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> to a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> after crossing the isolation boundary.  
  
6.  The host application displays the returned <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>.  
  
 For an example that demonstrates how to implement an add-in that returns a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], see [Create an Add-In That Returns a UI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/how-to-create-an-add-in-that-returns-a-ui.md).  
  
<a name="AddInIsAUI"></a>   
## Add-In Is a User Interface  
 When an add-in is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], the following are required:  
  
1.  The host application, add-in, and pipeline must be created, as described by the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] [Add-ins and Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/add-ins/index.md) documentation.  
  
2.  The contract interface for the add-in must implement <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>.  
  
3.  The add-in that is passed to the host application must directly or indirectly derive from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>.  
  
4.  The add-in must be converted from a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> to an <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> before crossing the isolation boundary.  
  
5.  The add-in must be converted from an <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract> to a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> after crossing the isolation boundary.  
  
6.  The host application displays the returned <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>.  
  
 For an example that demonstrates how to implement an add-in that is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], see [Create an Add-In That Is a UI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/how-to-create-an-add-in-that-is-a-ui.md).  
  
<a name="ReturningMultipleUIsFromAnAddIn"></a>   
## Returning Multiple UIs from an Add-In  
 Add-ins often provide multiple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] for host applications to display. For example, consider an add-in that is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that also provides status information to the host application, also as a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]. An add-in like this can be implemented by using a combination of techniques from both the [Add-In Returns a User Interface](#ReturnUIFromAddInContract) and [Add-In Is a User Interface](#AddInIsAUI) models.  
  
<a name="AddInsAndXBAPs"></a>   
## Add-Ins and XAML Browser Applications  
 In the examples so far, the host application has been an installed standalone application. But [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] can also host add-ins, albeit with the following additional build and implementation requirements:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] application manifest must be configured specially to download the pipeline (folders and assemblies) and add-in assembly to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clickonce](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clickonce-md.md)] application cache on the client machine, in the same folder as the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)].  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] code to discover and load add-ins must use the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clickonce](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-clickonce-md.md)] application cache for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] as the pipeline and add-in location.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] must load the add-in into a special security context if the add-in references loose files that are located at the site of origin; when hosted by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)], add-ins can only reference loose files that are located at the host application's site of origin.  
  
 These tasks are described in detail in the following subsections.  
  
### Configuring the Pipeline and Add-In for ClickOnce Deployment  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] are downloaded to and run from a safe folder in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clickonce](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-clickonce-md.md)] deployment cache. In order for an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] to host an add-in, the pipeline and add-in assembly must also be downloaded to the safe folder. To achieve this, you need to configure the application manifest to include both the pipeline and add-in assembly for download. This is most easily done in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)], although the pipeline and add-in assembly needs to be in the host [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] project's root folder in order for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)] to detect the pipeline assemblies.  
  
 Consequently, the first step is to build the pipeline and add-in assembly to the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] project's root by setting the build output of each pipeline assembly and add-in assembly projects. The following table shows the build output paths for pipeline assembly projects and add-in assembly project that are in the same solution and root folder as the host [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] project.  
  
 Table 1: Build Output Paths for the Pipeline Assemblies That Are Hosted by an XBAP  
  
|Pipeline assembly project|Build output path|  
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|  
|Contract|`..\HostXBAP\Contracts\`|  
|Add-In View|`..\HostXBAP\AddInViews\`|  
|Add-In-Side Adapter|`..\HostXBAP\AddInSideAdapters\`|  
|Host-Side Adapter|`..\HostXBAP\HostSideAdapters\`|  
|Add-In|`..\HostXBAP\AddIns\WPFAddIn1`|  
  
 The next step is to specify the pipeline assemblies and add-in assembly as the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] content files in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)] by doing the following:  
  
1.  Including the pipeline and add-in assembly in the project by right-clicking each pipeline folder in Solution Explorer and choosing **Include In Project**.  
  
2.  Setting the **Build Action** of each pipeline assembly and add-in assembly to **Content** from the **Properties** window.  
  
 The final step is to configure the application manifest to include the pipeline assembly files and add-in assembly file for download. The files should be located in folders at the root of the folder in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clickonce](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-clickonce-md.md)] cache that the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] application occupies. The configuration can be achieved in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)] by doing the following:  
  
1.  Right-click the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] project, click **Properties**, click **Publish**, and then click the **Application Files** button.  
  
2.  In the **Application Files** dialog, set the **Publish Status** of each pipeline and add-in DLL to **Include (Auto)**, and set the **Download Group** for each pipeline and add-in DLL to **(Required)**.  
  
### Using the Pipeline and Add-In from the Application Base  
 When the pipeline and add-in are configured for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clickonce](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-clickonce-md.md)] deployment, they are downloaded to the same [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_clickonce](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-clickonce-md.md)] cache folder as the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)]. To use the pipeline and add-in from the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] code must get them from the application base. The various types and members of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model for using pipelines and add-ins provide special support for this scenario. Firstly, the path is identified by the <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.PipelineStoreLocation.ApplicationBase> enumeration value. You use this value with overloads of the pertinent add-in members for using pipelines that include the following:  
  
-   <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.AddInStore.FindAddIns%28System.Type%2CSystem.AddIn.Hosting.PipelineStoreLocation%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
-   <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.AddInStore.FindAddIns%28System.Type%2CSystem.AddIn.Hosting.PipelineStoreLocation%2CSystem.String%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
-   <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.AddInStore.Rebuild%28System.AddIn.Hosting.PipelineStoreLocation%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
-   <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.AddInStore.Update%28System.AddIn.Hosting.PipelineStoreLocation%29?displayProperty=fullName>  
  
### Accessing the Host's Site of Origin  
 To ensure that an add-in can reference files from the site of origin, the add-in must be loaded with security isolation that is equivalent to the host application. This security level is identified by the <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.AddInSecurityLevel.Host?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration value, and passed to the <xref:System.AddIn.Hosting.AddInToken.Activate%2A> method when an add-in is activated.  
  
<a name="WPFAddInModelArchitecture"></a>   
## WPF Add-In Architecture  
 At the highest level, as we've seen, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] enables [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-ins to implement [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] (that derive directly or indirectly from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>) using <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> and <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A>. The result is that the host application is returned a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> that is displayed from [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] in the host application.  
  
 For simple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] add-in scenarios, this is as much detail as a developer needs. For more complex scenarios, particularly those that try to utilize additional [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] services such as layout, resources, and data binding, more detailed knowledge of how [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extends the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] support is required to understand its benefits and limitations.  
  
 Fundamentally, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] doesn't pass a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] from an add-in to a host application; instead, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] passes the Win32 window handle for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] interoperability. As such, when a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] from an add-in is passed to a host application, the following occurs:  
  
-   On the add-in side, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] acquires a window handle for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that will be displayed by the host application. The window handle is encapsulated by an internal [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> and implements <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>. An instance of this class is returned by <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> and is marshaled from the add-in's application domain to the host application's application domain.  
  
-   On the host application side, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] repackages the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> as an internal [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> and consumes <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>. An instance of this class is returned by <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A> to the host application.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> exists to display [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)], identified by window handles, from [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)]. For more information, see [WPF and Win32 Interoperation](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-and-win32-interoperation.md).  
  
 In summary, <xref:System.AddIn.Contract.INativeHandleContract>, <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A>, and <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A> exist to allow the window handle for a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to be passed from an add-in to a host application, where it is encapsulated by a <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> and displayed the host application's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Because the host application gets an <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost>, the host application cannot convert the object that is returned by <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ContractToViewAdapter%2A> to the type it is implemented as by the add-in (for example, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>).  
  
 By its nature, <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> has certain limitations that affect how host applications can use them. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extends <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> with several capabilities for add-in scenarios. These benefits and limitations are described below.  
  
<a name="WPFAddInModelBenefits"></a>   
## WPF Add-In Benefits  
 Because [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] are displayed from host applications using an internal class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost>, those [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] are constrained by the capabilities of <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> with respect to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] services such as layout, rendering, data binding, styles, templates, and resources. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] augments its internal <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> subclass with additional capabilities that include the following:  
  
-   Tabbing between a host application's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] and an add-in's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]. Note that the "add-in is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]" programming model requires the add-in-side adapter to override <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> to enable tabbing, whether the add-in is fully trusted or partially trusted.  
  
-   Honoring accessibility requirements for add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] that are displayed from host application [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)].  
  
-   Enabling [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications to run safely in multiple application domain scenarios.  
  
-   Preventing illegal access to add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] window handles when add-ins run with security isolation (that is, a partial-trust security sandbox). Calling <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> ensures this security:  
  
    -   For the "add-in returns a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]" programming model, the only way to pass the window handle for an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] across the isolation boundary is to call <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A>.  
  
    -   For the "add-in is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]" programming model, overriding <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.ContractBase.QueryContract%2A> on the add-in-side adapter and calling <xref:System.AddIn.Pipeline.FrameworkElementAdapters.ViewToContractAdapter%2A> (as shown in the preceding examples) is required, as is calling the add-in-side adapter's `QueryContract` implementation from the host-side adapter.  
  
-   Providing multiple application domain execution protection. Due to limitations with application domains, unhandled exceptions that are thrown in add-in application domains cause the entire application to crash, even though the isolation boundary exists. However, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] add-in model provide a simple way to work around this problem and improve application stability. A [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] add-in that displays a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] creates a <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> for the thread that the application domain runs on, if the host application is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application. You can detect all unhandled exceptions that occur in the application domain by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.UnhandledException> event of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] add-in's <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher>. You can get the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> from the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher%2A> property.  
  
<a name="WPFAddInModelLimitations"></a>   
## WPF Add-In Limitations  
 Beyond the benefits that [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] adds to the default behaviors supplied by <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource>, <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost>, and window handles, there are also limitations for add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] that are displayed from host applications:  
  
-   Add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] displayed from a host application do not respect the host application's clipping behavior.  
  
-   The concept of *airspace* in interoperability scenarios also applies to add-ins (see [Technology Regions Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/technology-regions-overview.md)).  
  
-   A host application's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] services, such as resource inheritance, data binding, and commanding, are not automatically available to add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)]. To provide these services to the add-in, you need to update the pipeline.  
  
-   An add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] cannot be rotated, scaled, skewed, or otherwise affected by a transformation (see [Transforms Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/transforms-overview.md)).  
  
-   Content inside add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] that is rendered by drawing operations from the <xref:System.Drawing> namespace can include alpha blending. However, both an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] and the host application [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that contains it must be 100% opaque; in other words, the `Opacity` property on both must be set to 1.  
  
-   If the <xref:System.Windows.Window.AllowsTransparency%2A> property of a window in the host application that contains an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] is set to `true`, the add-in is invisible. This is true even if the add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] is 100% opaque (that is, the `Opacity` property has a value of 1).  
  
-   An add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] must appear on top of other [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] elements in the same top-level window.  
  
-   No portion of an add-in's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] can be rendered using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualBrush>. Instead, the add-in may take a snapshot of the generated [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to create a bitmap that can be passed to the host application using methods defined by the contract.  
  
-   Media files cannot be played from a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.MediaElement> in an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)].  
  
-   Mouse events generated for the add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] are neither received nor raised by the host application, and the `IsMouseOver` property for host application [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] has a value of `false`.  
  
-   When focus shifts between controls in an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], the `GotFocus` and `LostFocus` events are neither received nor raised by the host application.  
  
-   The portion of a host application that contains an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] appears white when printed.  
  
-   All dispatchers (see <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher>) created by the add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] must be shut down manually before the owner add-in is unloaded if the host application continues execution. The contract can implement methods that allow the host application to signal the add-in before the add-in is unloaded, thereby allowing the add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to shut down its dispatchers.  
  
-   If an add-in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] is an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> or contains an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>, you cannot unload the add-in.  
  
<a name="PerformanceOptimization"></a>   
## Performance Optimization  
 By default, when multiple application domains are used, the various [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assemblies required by each application are all loaded into that application's domain. As a result, the time required for creating new application domains and starting applications in them might affect performance. However, the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] provides a way for you to reduce start times by instructing applications to share assemblies across application domains if they are already loaded. You do this by using the <xref:System.LoaderOptimizationAttribute> attribute, which must be applied to the entry point method (`Main`). In this case, you must use only code to implement your application definition (see [Application Management Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/application-management-overview.md)).
