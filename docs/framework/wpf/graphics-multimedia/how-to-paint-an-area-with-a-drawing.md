# How to: Paint an Area with a Drawing
This example shows how to paint an area with a drawing. To paint an area with a drawing, you use a              <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> and one or more              <xref:System.Windows.Media.Drawing> objects.   The following example uses a              <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> to paint an object with a drawing of two ellipses.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-xaml[drawingbrush_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_snip/CS/DrawingBrushExample.xaml#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  
  
 [!code-csharp[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/CSharp/DrawingBrushExample.cs#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]
 [!code-vb[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/VisualBasic/DrawingBrushExample.vb#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  
  
 The following illustration shows the example's output.

 (The center of the shape is white for reasons described in                      [Control the Fill of a Composite Shape](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-control-the-fill-of-a-composite-shape.md).)  
  
 By setting a                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> object's                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.Viewport%2A> and                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.TileMode%2A> properties, you can create a repeating pattern. The following example paints an object with a pattern created from a drawing of two ellipses.

 The following illustration shows the tiled                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> output.
