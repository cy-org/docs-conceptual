# How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element
This example shows how to draw a closed shape by using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> element. To draw a closed shape, create a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> element and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon.Points%2A> property to specify the vertices of a shape. A line is automatically drawn that connects the first and last points. Finally, specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A>, or both.  
  
## Example  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], valid syntax for points is a space-delimited list of comma-separated x- and y-coordinate pairs.  
  
 [!code-xaml[drawingwithshapeelements#PolygonExample1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/polygonexample.xaml#polygonexample1)]  
  
 Although the example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to contain the polygons, you can use polygon elements (and all the other shape elements) with any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that supports non-text content.  
  
 This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037).
