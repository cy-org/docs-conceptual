# How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene
The following example shows how to animate the position of a camera and animate the direction it is pointing in a 3D scene. This is done by using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A> properties respectively of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera>. You might use an animation like this to change the onlooker's view of a scene in response to an event.
