# How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames
In the following example, <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimationUsingKeyFrames> is used to animate the position of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera> in a 3D scene. In addition, <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimationUsingKeyFrames> is used to animate the direction the camera is pointing in the 3D scene. Both of these animations use several key frames which create a series of animation effects:  
  
1.  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.LinearPoint3DKeyFrame> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.LinearVector3DKeyFrame> are used to create a smooth, linear interpolation between values.  
  
2.  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DiscretePoint3DKeyFrame> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DiscreteVector3DKeyFrame> are used to create sudden "jumps" between values (no interpolation).  
  
3.  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SplinePoint3DKeyFrame> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SplineVector3DKeyFrame> are used to create a variable transition between values depending on the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SplinePoint3DKeyFrame.KeySpline%2A> property. In the example below, the animation starts off slow but toward the end of the time segment, speeds up exponentially.
