# How to: Accelerate or Decelerate an Animation
This example demonstrates how to make an animation accelerate and decelerate over time. In the following example, several rectangles are animated by animations with different          <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.AccelerationRatio%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.DecelerationRatio%2A> settings.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-xaml[timingbehaviors_snip#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AccelDecelExample.xaml#1)]  
  
 Code has been omitted from this example. For the complete code, see the [Animation Timing Behavior Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159970).
