# Shapes
[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] provides support for drawing basic shapes using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> class. Shape objects derive from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> and as such, participate in the layout system and can be drawn simply using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)].
