# Deploying .NET Framework Applications
This section of the .NET Framework documentation provides essential information for deploying .NET Framework applications, including guidelines for loading assemblies, resolving assembly references, and improving the performance of your application through native image generation.  
  
## In This Section  
 [How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)  
 Describes how the common language runtime locates and binds to the assemblies that make up your application.  
  
 [Best Practices for Assembly Loading](../../../docs/framework/deployment/best-practices-for-assembly-loading.md)  
 Discusses ways to avoid problems of type identity that can lead to <xref:System.InvalidCastException>, <xref:System.MissingMethodException>, and other errors.
