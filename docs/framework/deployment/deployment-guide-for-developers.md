# .NET Framework deployment guide for developers
This topic provides information for developers who want to install the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, the [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)], 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or the .NET Framework 4.7 with their apps.

For download links, see the section [Redistributable Packages](#redistributable-packages). You can also download the redistributable packages and language packs from these Microsoft Download Center pages:

- .NET Framework 4.7 for all operating systems ([web installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=825299) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=825303))

- [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] for all operating systems ([web installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=780597) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=780601))

- [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] for all operating systems ([web installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=671729) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=671744))

- [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] for all operating systems ([web installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528222) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528232))

- .NET Framework 4.5.2 for all operating systems ([web installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=397703) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=397706))

- .NET Framework 4.5.1 for all operating systems ([web installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=310158) or [offline installer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=310159))

- [.NET Framework 4.5](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=245484)

 Important notes:

> [!NOTE]
> The phrase "the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] and its point releases"  refers to the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, and 4.7.

- The [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)], 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, and 4.7 are in-place updates to the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], which means they use the same runtime version, but the assembly versions are updated and include new types and members.

- The [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] and its point releases are built incrementally on the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)]. When you install the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7 on a system that has the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] installed, the version 4 assemblies are replaced with newer versions.

- If you are referencing a Microsoft [out-of-band package](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn151288\(v=vs.110\).aspx) in your app, the assembly will be included in the app package.

- You must have administrator privileges to install the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] and its point releases.

- The [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] is included in [!INCLUDE[win8](../../../includes/win8-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[winserver8](../../../includes/winserver8-md.md)], so you don't have to deploy it with your app on those operating systems. Similarly, the [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)] is included in [!INCLUDE[win81](../../../includes/win81-md.md)] and Windows Server 2012 R2. The .NET Framework 4.5.2 isn't included in any operating systems. The [!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] is included in Windows 10, the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] is included in Windows 10 November Update, and the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] is included in Windows 10 Anniversary Update.  The .NET Framework 4.7 is included in Windows 10 Creators Update. For a full list of hardware and software requirements, see [System Requirements](../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).

- Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], your users can view a list of running .NET Framework apps during setup and close them easily. This may help avoid system restarts caused by .NET Framework installations. See [Reducing System Restarts](../../../docs/framework/deployment/reducing-system-restarts.md).

- Uninstalling the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or one of its point releases also removes pre-existing [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] files. If you want to go back to the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)], you must reinstall it and any updates to it. (See [Installing the .NET Framework 4](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5a4x27ek\(v=vs.100\).aspx).)

- The .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable was updated on October 9, 2012 to correct an issue related to an improper timestamp on a digital certificate, which caused the digital signature on files produced and signed by Microsoft to expire prematurely. If you previously installed the .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable package dated August 16, 2012, we recommend that you update your copy with the latest redistributable from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=245484). For more information about this issue, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2749655).

 For information about how a system administrator can deploy the .NET Framework and its system dependencies across a network, see [Deployment Guide for Administrators](../../../docs/framework/deployment/guide-for-administrators.md).

## Deployment options for your app
 When you're ready to publish your app to a web server or other centralized location so that users can install it, you can choose from several deployment methods. Some of these are provided with Visual Studio. The following table lists the deployment options for your app, and specifies the .NET Framework redistributable package that supports each option. In addition to these, you can write a custom setup program for your app; for more information, see the section [Chaining the .NET Framework Installation to Your App's Setup](#chaining).

|Deployment strategy for your app|Deployment methods available|.NET Framework redistributable to use|
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Install from the web|- [InstallAware](#installaware-deployment)<br />- [InstallShield](#installshield-deployment)<br />- [WiX toolset](#wix)<br />- [Manual installation](#installing_manually)|[Web installer](#redistributable-packages)|
|Install from disc|- [InstallAware](#installaware-deployment)<br />- [InstallShield](#installshield-deployment)<br />- [WiX toolset](#wix)<br />- [Manual installation](#installing_manually)|[Offline installer](#redistributable-packages)|
|Install from a local area network (for enterprise apps)|- [ClickOnce](#clickonce-deployment)|Either [web installer](#redistributable-packages) (see [ClickOnce](#clickonce-deployment) for restrictions) or [offline installer](#redistributable-packages)|

## Redistributable Packages
 The .NET Framework is available in two redistributable packages: web installer (bootstrapper) and offline installer (stand-alone redistributable). The following table compares the two packages.

||Web installer|Offline installer|

 \* The offline installer is larger because it contains the components for all the target platforms. When you finish running setup, the Windows operating system caches only the installer that was used. If the offline installer is deleted after the installation, the disk space used is the same as that used by the web installer. If the tool you use (for example, [InstallAware](#installaware-deployment) or [InstallShield](#installshield-deployment)) to create your app's setup program provides a setup file folder that is removed after installation, the offline installer can be automatically deleted by placing it into the setup folder.

 ** If you're using the web installer with custom setup, you can use default language settings based on the user's Multilingual User Interface (MUI) setting, or specify another language pack by using the `/LCID` option on the command line. See the section [Chaining by Using the Default .NET Framework UI](#chaining_default) for examples.

## Deployment methods
 Four deployment methods are available:

- You can set a dependency on the .NET Framework. You can specify the .NET Framework as a prerequisite in your app's installation, using one of these methods:

    - Use [ClickOnce deployment](#clickonce-deployment) (available with Visual Studio)

    - Create an [InstallAware project](#installaware-deployment) (free edition available for Visual Studio users)

    - Create an [InstallShield project](#installshield-deployment) (available with Visual Studio)

    - Use the [Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset](#wix)

- You can ask your users to [install the .NET Framework manually](#installing_manually).

- You can chain (include) the .NET Framework setup process in your app's setup, and decide how you want to handle the .NET Framework installation experience:

    - [Use the default UI](#chaining_default). Let the .NET Framework installer provide the installation experience.

    - [Customize the UI](#chaining_custom) to present a unified installation experience and to monitor the .NET Framework installation progress.

 These deployment methods are discussed in detail in the following sections.

## Setting a dependency on the .NET Framework
If you use ClickOnce, InstallAware, InstallShield, or WiX to deploy your app, you can add a dependency on the .NET Framework so it can be installed as part of your app.

### ClickOnce deployment
 ClickOnce deployment is available for projects that are created with Visual Basic and Visual C#, but it is not available for Visual C++.

 In Visual Studio, to choose ClickOnce deployment and add a dependency on the .NET Framework:

1.  Open the app project you want to publish.

2.  In Solution Explorer, open the shortcut menu for your project, and then choose **Properties**.

3.  Choose the **Publish** pane.

4.  Choose the **Prerequisites** button.

5.  In the **Prerequisites** dialog box, make sure that the **Create setup program to install prerequisite components** check box is selected.

6.  In the prerequisites list, locate and select the version of the .NET Framework that you've used to build your project.

7.  Choose an option to specify the source location for the prerequisites, and then choose **OK**.

     If you supply a URL for the .NET Framework download location, you can specify either the Microsoft Download Center site or a site of your own. If you are placing the redistributable package on your own server, it must be the offline installer and not the web installer. You can only link to the web installer on the Microsoft Download Center. The URL can also specify a disc on which your own app is being distributed.

8.  In the **Property Pages** dialog box, choose **OK**.

<a name="installaware"></a> 
### InstallAware deployment
InstallAware builds Windows app (APPX), Windows Installer (MSI), Native Code (EXE), and App-V (Application Virtualization) packages from a single source. Easily [include any version of the .NET Framework](https://www.installaware.com/one-click-pre-requisite-installer.htm) in your setup, optionally customizing the installation by [editing the default scripts](https://www.installaware.com/msicode.htm). For example, InstallAware pre-installs certificates on Windows 7, without which the .NET Framework 4.7 setup fails. For more information on InstallAware, see the [InstallAware for Windows Installer](https://www.installaware.com/) website.

### InstallShield deployment
 In Visual Studio, to choose InstallShield deployment and add a dependency on the .NET Framework:

1.  On the Visual Studio menu bar, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**.

2.  In the left pane of the **New Project** dialog box, choose **Other Project Types**, **Setup and Deployment**, **InstallShield LE**.

3.  In the **Name** box, type a name for your project, and then choose **OK**.

4.  If you are creating a setup and deployment  project for the first time, choose **Go to InstallShield** or **Enable InstallShield Limited Edition** to download InstallShield Limited Edition for your version of Microsoft Visual Studio . Restart Visual Studio.

5.  Go to **Project Assistant** wizard and choose **Application Files** to add the Project Output. You can configure other project attributes by using this wizard.

6.  Go to **Installation Requirements** and select the operating systems and the version of the .NET Framework you want to install.

7.  Open the shortcut menu for your setup project and choose **Build**.
 
<a name="wix"></a> 
### Windows Installer XML (WiX) deployment
 The Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset builds Windows installation packages from XML source code. WiX supports a command-line environment that can be integrated into your build processes to build MSI and MSM setup packages. By using WiX, you can [specify the .NET Framework as a prerequisite](http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/howtos/redistributables_and_install_checks/install_dotnet.html), or [create a chainer](http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/xsd/wix/exepackage.html) to fully control the .NET Framework deployment experience. For more information about WiX, see the [Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/) website.

<a name="installing_manually"></a> 
## Installing the .NET Framework manually
 In some situations, it might be impractical to automatically install the .NET Framework with your app. In that case, you can have users install the .NET Framework themselves. The redistributable package is available in [two packages](#redistributable-packages). In your setup process, provide instructions for how users should locate and install the .NET Framework.

<a name="chaining"></a> 
## Chaining the .NET Framework installation to your app's setup
 If you're creating a custom setup program for your app, you can chain (include) the .NET Framework setup process in your app's setup process. Chaining provides two UI options for the .NET Framework installation:

- Use the default UI provided by the .NET Framework installer.

- Create a custom UI for the .NET Framework installation for consistency with your app's setup program.

 Both methods allow you to use either the web installer or the offline installer. Each package has its advantages:

- If you use the web installer, the .NET Framework setup process will decide which installation package is required, and download and install only that package from the web.

- If you use the offline installer, you can include the complete set of .NET Framework installation packages with your redistribution media so that your users don't have to download any additional files from the web during setup.

<a name="chaining_default"></a> 
### Chaining by using the default .NET Framework UI
 To silently chain the .NET Framework installation process and let the .NET Framework installer provide the UI, add the following command to your setup program:

```
<.NET Framework redistributable> /q /norestart /ChainingPackage <PackageName>
```

 For example, if your executable program is Contoso.exe and you want to silently install the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] offline redistributable package, use the command:

```
dotNetFx45_Full_x86_x64.exe /q /norestart /ChainingPackage Contoso
```

 You can use additional command-line options to customize the installation. For example:

- To provide a way for users to close running .NET Framework apps to minimize system restarts, set passive mode and use the `/showrmui` option as follows:

    ```
    dotNetFx45_Full_x86_x64.exe /norestart /passive /showrmui /ChainingPackage Contoso
    ```

     This command allows Restart Manager to display a message box that gives users the opportunity to close .NET Framework apps before installing the .NET Framework.

- If you're using the web installer, you can use the `/LCID` option to specify a language pack. For example, to chain the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] web installer to your Contoso setup program and install the Japanese language pack, add the following command to your app's setup process:

    ```
    dotNetFx45_Full_setup.exe /q /norestart /ChainingPackage Contoso /LCID 1041
    ```

     If you omit the `/LCID` option, setup will install the language pack that matches the user's MUI setting.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Different language packs may have different release dates. If the language pack you specify is not available at the download center, setup will install the .NET Framework without the language pack. If the .NET Framework is already installed on the user’s computer, the setup will install only the language pack.

 For a complete list of options, see the [Command-Line Options](#command-line-options) section.

 For common return codes, see the [Return Codes](#return-codes) section.

<a name="chaining_custom"></a>
### Chaining by Using a Custom UI
 If you have a custom setup package, you may want to silently launch and track the .NET Framework setup while showing your own view of the setup progress. If this is the case, make sure that your code covers the following:

- Check for [.NET Framework hardware and software requirements](../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).

- [Detect](#detect_net) whether the correct version of the .NET Framework is already installed on the user’s computer.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > In determining whether the correct version of the .NET Framework is already installed, you should check whether your target version *or* a later version is installed, not whether your target version is installed. In other words, you should evaluate whether the release key you retrieve from the registry is greater than or equal to the release key of your target version, *not* whether it equals the release key of your target version.

- [Detect](#detecting-the-language-packs) whether the language packs are already installed on the user’s computer.

- If you want to control the deployment, silently launch and track the .NET Framework setup process (see [How to: Get Progress from the .NET Framework 4.5 Installer](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-to-get-progress-from-the-dotnet-installer.md)).

- If you’re deploying the offline installer, [chain the language packs separately](#chain_langpack).

- Customize deployment by using [command-line options](#command-line-options). For example, if you’re chaining the .NET Framework web installer, but you want to override the default language pack, use the `/LCID` option, as described in the previous section.

- [Troubleshoot](#troubleshooting).

<a name="detect_net"></a>
### Detecting the .NET Framework
 The .NET Framework installer writes registry keys when installation is successful. You can test whether the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or later is installed by checking the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full` folder in the registry for a `DWORD` value named `Release`. (Note that "NET Framework Setup" doesn't begin with a period.) The existence of this key indicates that the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or a later version has been installed on that computer. The value of `Release` indicates which version of the .NET Framework is installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should check for a value  **greater than or equal to** the release keyword value when attempting to detect whether a specific version is present.

|Version|Value of the Release DWORD|
|-------------|--------------------------------|
|.NET Framework 4.7 installed on Windows 10 Creators Update|460798|
|.NET Framework 4.7 installed on all OS versions other than Windows 10 Creators Update|460805|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] installed on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition|394802|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] installed on all OS versions other than Windows 10 Anniversary Edition|394806|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] installed on Windows 10 November Update|394254|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] installed on all OS versions other than Windows 10 November Update|394271|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] installed on Windows 10|393295|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] installed on all OS versions other than Windows 10|393297|
|.NET Framework 4.5.2|379893|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)] installed with [!INCLUDE[win81](../../../includes/win81-md.md)] or Windows Server 2012 R2|378675|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)] installed on [!INCLUDE[win8](../../../includes/win8-md.md)], Windows 7|378758|
|[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]|378389|

### Detecting the language packs
 You can test whether a specific language pack is installed by checking the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full\\*LCID* folder in the registry for a DWORD value named `Release`. (Note that "NET Framework Setup" doesn't begin with a period.) *LCID* specifies a locale identifier; see [supported languages](#supported-languages) for a list of these.

 For example, to detect whether the full Japanese language pack (LCID=1041) is installed, check for the following values in the registry:

```
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full\1041
Name: Release
Type: DWORD

 To determine whether the final release version of a language pack is installed for the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7, check the value of the RELEASE key DWORD value described in the previous section, [Detecting the .NET Framework](#detect_net).

### Chaining the language packs to your app setup
 The .NET Framework provides a set of stand-alone language pack executable files that contain localized resources for specific cultures. The language packs are available from the Microsoft Download Center:

- [.NET Framework 4.7 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=825306)

- [.NET Framework 4.6.2 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=780604)

- [.NET Framework 4.6.1 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=671747)

- [.NET Framework 4.6 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528314)

- [.NET Framework 4.5.2 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=397701)

- [.NET Framework 4.5.1 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=322101)

- [.NET Framework 4.5 language packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=245451)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The language packs don't contain the .NET Framework components that are required to run an app; you must install the .NET Framework by using the web or offline installer before you install a language pack.

 Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)], the package names take the form NDP<`version`>-KB<`number`>-x86-x64-AllOS-<`culture`>.exe, where `version` is the version number of the .NET Framework, `number` is a Microsoft Knowledge Base article number, and `culture` specifies a [country/region](#supported-languages). An example of one of these packages is `NDP452-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-JPN.exe`. Package names are listed in the [Redistributable Packages](#redistributable-packages) section earlier in this article.

 To install a language pack with the .NET Framework offline installer, you must chain it to your app's setup. For example, to deploy the [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)] offline installer with the Japanese language pack, use the following command:

```
NDP451-KB2858728-x86-x64-AllOS-JPN.exe/q /norestart /ChainingPackage <ProductName>
```

 You do not have to chain the language packs if you use the web installer; setup will install the language pack that matches the user's MUI setting. If you want to install a different language, you can use the `/LCID` option to specify a language pack.

 For a complete list of command-line options, see the [Command-Line Options](#command-line-options) section.

### Troubleshooting

#### Return codes
 The following table lists the most common return codes for the .NET Framework redistributable installer. The return codes are the same for all versions of the installer. For links to detailed information, see the next section.

|Return code|Description|
|-----------------|-----------------|
|0|Installation completed successfully.|
|1602|The user canceled installation.|
|1603|A fatal error occurred during installation.|
|1641|A restart is required to complete the installation. This message indicates success.|
|3010|A restart is required to complete the installation. This message indicates success.|
|5100|The user's computer does not meet system requirements.|

## Uninstalling the .NET Framework
 Starting with [!INCLUDE[win8](../../../includes/win8-md.md)], you can uninstall the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7, by using **Turn Windows features on and off** in Control Panel. In older versions of Windows, you can uninstall the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7 by using **Add or Remove Programs** in Control Panel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Windows 7 and earlier operating systems, uninstalling the [!INCLUDE[net_v451](../../../includes/net-v451-md.md)], 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, or 4.7 doesn't restore [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] files, and uninstalling the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] doesn't restore [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] files. If you want to go back to the older version, you must reinstall it and any updates to it.

## Appendix

### Command-line options
 The following table lists options that you can include when you chain the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] redistributable to your app's setup.

|Option|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|**/CEIPConsent**|Overwrites the default behavior and sends anonymous feedback to Microsoft to improve future deployment experiences. This option can be used only if the setup program prompts for consent and if the user grants permission to send anonymous feedback to Microsoft.|
|**/chainingpackage** `packageName`|Specifies the name of the executable that is doing the chaining. This information is sent to Microsoft as anonymous feedback to help improve future deployment experiences.<br /><br /> If the package name includes spaces, use double quotation marks as delimiters; for example: **/chainingpackage "Lucerne Publishing"**. For an example of a chaining package, see [Getting Progress Information from an Installation Package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=181926) in the MSDN Library.|
|**/LCID**  `LCID`<br /><br /> where `LCID` specifies a locale identifier (see [supported languages](#supported-languages))|Installs the language pack specified by `LCID` and forces the displayed UI to be shown in that language, unless quiet mode is set.<br /><br /> For the web installer, this option chain-installs the language package from the web. **Note:**  Use this option only with the web installer.|
|**/log** `file` &#124; `folder`|Specifies the location of the log file. The default is the temporary folder for the process, and the default file name is based on the package. If the file extension is .txt, a text log is produced. If you specify any other extension or no extension, an HTML log is created.|
|**/msioptions**|Specifies options to be passed for .msi and .msp items; for example: `/msioptions "PROPERTY1='Value'"`.|
|**/norestart**|Prevents the setup program from rebooting automatically. If you use this option, the chaining app has to capture the return code and handle rebooting (see [Getting Progress Information from an Installation Package](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179606) in the MSDN Library).|
|**/passive**|Sets passive mode. Displays the progress bar to indicate that installation is in progress, but does not display any prompts or error messages to the user. In this mode, when chained by a setup program, the chaining package must handle [return codes](#return-codes).|
|**/pipe**|Creates a communication channel to enable a chaining package to get progress.|
|**/promptrestart**|Passive mode only, if the setup program requires a restart, it prompts the user. This option requires user interaction if a restart is required.|
|**/q**|Sets quiet mode.|
|**/repair**|Triggers the repair functionality.|
|**/serialdownload**|Forces the installation to happen only after the package has been downloaded.|
|**/showfinalerror**|Sets passive mode. Displays errors only if the installation is not successful. This option requires user interaction if the installation is not successful.|
|**/showrmui**|Used only with the **/passive** option. Displays a message box that prompts users to close .NET Framework apps that are currently running. This message box behaves the same in passive and non-passive mode.|
|**/uninstall**|Uninstalls the .NET Framework redistributable.|
