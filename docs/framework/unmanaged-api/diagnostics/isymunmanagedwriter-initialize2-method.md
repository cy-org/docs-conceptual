# ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method
Sets the metadata emitter interface with which this writer will be associated, and sets the output file name to which the debugging symbols will be written. This method also lets you set the final location of the program database (PDB) file.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Initialize2(  
    [in] IUnknown     *emitter,  
    [in] const WCHAR  *tempfilename,  
    [in] IStream      *pIStream,  
    [in] BOOL         fFullBuild,  
    [in] const WCHAR  *finalfilename);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `emitter`  
 [in] A pointer to the metadata emitter interface.  
  
 `tempfilename`  
 [in] A pointer to a `WCHAR` that contains the file name to which the debugging symbols are written. If a file name is specified for a writer that does not use file names, this parameter is ignored.  
  
 `pIStream`  
 [in] If specified, the symbol writer emits the symbols into the given <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream> rather than to the file specified in the `filename` parameter. The `pIStream` parameter is optional.  
  
 `fFullBuild`  
 [in] `true` if this is a full rebuild; `false` if this is an incremental compilation.  
  
 `finalfilename`  
 [in] A pointer to a `WCHAR` that is the path string to the final location of the PDB file.  
  
## Return Value  
 S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h
