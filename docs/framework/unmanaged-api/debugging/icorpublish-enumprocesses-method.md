# ICorPublish::EnumProcesses Method
Gets an enumerator for the managed processes running on this computer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT EnumProcesses (  
    [in] COR_PUB_ENUMPROCESS       Type,  
    [out] ICorPublishProcessEnum   **ppIEnum  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Type`  
 A value of the [COR_PUB_ENUMPROCESS](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/cor-pub-enumprocess-enumeration.md) enumeration that specifies the type of process to be retrieved. In the current version, only COR_PUB_MANAGEDONLY is valid.  
  
 `ppIEnum`  
 A pointer to the address of an [ICorPublishProcessEnum](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icorpublishprocessenum-interface.md) instance that is the enumerator of the processes.  
  
## Remarks  
 The enumerator's collection of processes is based on a snapshot of the processes that are running when the `EnumProcesses` method is called. The enumerator will not include any processes that terminate before or start after `EnumProcesses` is called.  
  
 The `EnumProcesses` method may be called more than once on this [ICorPublish](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icorpublish-interface.md) instance to create a new up-to-date collection of processes. Existing collections will not be affected by subsequent calls of the `EnumProcesses` method.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorPub.idl, CorPub.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
