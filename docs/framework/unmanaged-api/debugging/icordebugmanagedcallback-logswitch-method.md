# ICorDebugManagedCallback::LogSwitch Method
Notifies the debugger that a common language runtime (CLR) managed thread has called a method in the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Switch> class to create, modify, or delete a debugging/tracing switch.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT LogSwitch (  
    [in] ICorDebugAppDomain  *pAppDomain,  
    [in] ICorDebugThread     *pThread,  
    [in] LONG                 lLevel,  
    [in] ULONG                ulReason,  
    [in] WCHAR               *pLogSwitchName,  
    [in] WCHAR               *pParentName);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `PAppDomain`  
 [in] A pointer to an ICorDebugAppDomain object that represents the application domain containing the managed thread that created, modified, or deleted a debugging/tracing switch.  
  
 `pThread`  
 [in] A pointer to an ICorDebugThread object that represents the managed thread.  
  
 `lLevel`  
 [in] A value that indicates the severity level of the descriptive message that was written to the event log.  
  
 `ulReason`  
 [in] A value of the [LogSwitchCallReason](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/logswitchcallreason-enumeration.md) enumeration that indicates the operation performed on the debugging/tracing switch.  
  
 `pLogSwitchName`  
 [in] A pointer to the name of the debugging/tracing switch.  
  
 `pParentName`  
 [in] A pointer to the name of the parent of the debugging/tracing switch.
