# ICorDebugProcess2::ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint Method
Removes a previously set breakpoint at the given address.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint (  
    [in] CORDB_ADDRESS   address  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `address`  
 [in] A `CORDB_ADDRESS` value that specifies the address at which the breakpoint was set.  
  
## Remarks  
 The specified breakpoint would have been previously set by an earlier call to [ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md).  
  
 The `ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint` method can be called while the process being debugged is running.  
  
 The `ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint` method returns a failure code if the debugger is attached in managed-only mode or if no breakpoint exists at the specified address.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]
