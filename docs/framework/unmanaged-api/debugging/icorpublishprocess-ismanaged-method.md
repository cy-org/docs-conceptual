# ICorPublishProcess::IsManaged Method
Gets a value that indicates whether the process referenced by this [ICorPublishProcess](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icorpublishprocess-interface.md) is known to have managed code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT IsManaged (  
    [out] BOOL   *pbManaged  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pbManaged`  
 [out] A pointer to a Boolean value that indicates whether the process has managed code. The value is `true` if the process has managed code; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Remarks  
 Since the current version of `ICorPublishProcess` allows access only to processes that have managed code, `IsManaged` always returns `true`.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorPub.idl, CorPub.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
