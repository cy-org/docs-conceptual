# ICorDebugManagedCallback2::ChangeConnection Method
Notifies the debugger that the set of tasks associated with the specified connection has changed.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ChangeConnection (  
    [in] ICorDebugProcess     *pProcess,  
    [in] CONNID               dwConnectionId  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pProcess`  
 [in] A pointer to an "ICorDebugProcess" object that represents the process containing the connection that changed.  
  
 `dwConnectionId`  
 [in] The ID of the connection that changed.  
  
## Remarks  
 A `ChangeConnection` callback will be fired in either of the following cases:  
  
-   When a debugger attaches to a process that contains connections. In this case, the runtime will generate and dispatch a [ICorDebugManagedCallback2::CreateConnection](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugmanagedcallback2-createconnection-method.md) event and a `ChangeConnection` event for each connection in the process. A `ChangeConnection` event is generated for every existing connection, regardless of whether that connectionâ€™s set of tasks has been changed since its creation.  
  
-   When a host calls [ICLRDebugManager::SetConnectionTasks](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-setconnectiontasks-method.md) in the [Hosting API](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/index.md).  
  
 The debugger should scan all threads in the process to pick up the new changes.
