# ICorDebugILCode::GetEHClauses Method
[Supported in the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and later versions]  
  
 Returns a pointer to a list of exception handling (EH) clauses that are defined for this intermediate language (IL).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
HRESULT GetEHClauses(  
   [in] ULONG32 cClauses,  
   [out] ULONG32 * pcClauses,  
   [out, size_is(cClauses), length_is(*pcClauses)] CorDebugEHClause clauses[]);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `cClauses`  
 [in] The storage capacity of the `clauses` array. See the Remarks section for more information.  
  
 `pcClauses`  
 [out] The number of clauses about which information is written to the `clauses` array.  
  
 clauses  
 [out] An array of [CorDebugEHClause](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/cordebugehclause-structure.md) objects that contain information on exception handling clauses defined for this IL.  
  
## Remarks  
 If `cClauses` is 0 and `pcClauses` is non-**null**, `pcClauses` is set to the number of available exception handling clauses. If `cClauses` is non-zero, it represents the storage capacity of the `clauses` array. When the method returns, `clauses` contains a maximum of `cClauses` items, and `pcClauses` is set to the number of clauses actually written to the `clauses` array.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v452plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v452plus-md.md)]
