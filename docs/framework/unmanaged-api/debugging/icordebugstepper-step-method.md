# ICorDebugStepper::Step Method
Causes this ICorDebugStepper to single-step through its containing thread, and optionally, to continue single-stepping through functions that are called within the thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Step (  
    [in] BOOL   bStepIn  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bStepIn`  
 [in] Set to `true` to step into a function that is called within the thread. Set to `false` to step over the function.  
  
## Remarks  
 The step completes when the common language runtime performs the next managed instruction in this stepper's frame. If `Step` is called on a stepper, which is not in managed code, the step will complete when the next managed code instruction is executed by the thread.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
