# ICorDebugManagedCallback::BreakpointSetError Method
Notifies the debugger that the common language runtime was unable to accurately bind a breakpoint that was set before a function was just-in-time (JIT) compiled.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT BreakpointSetError (  
    [in] ICorDebugAppDomain  *pAppDomain,  
    [in] ICorDebugThread     *pThread,  
    [in] ICorDebugBreakpoint *pBreakpoint,  
    [in] DWORD                dwError  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pAppDomain`  
 [in] A pointer to an ICorDebugAppDomain object that represents the application domain that contains the unbound breakpoint.  
  
 `pThread`  
 [in] A pointer to an ICorDebugThread object that represents the thread that contains the unbound breakpoint.  
  
 `pBreakpoint`  
 [in] A pointer to an ICorDebugBreakpoint object that represents the unbound breakpoint.  
  
 `dwError`  
 [in] An integer that indicates the error.  
  
## Remarks  
 The given breakpoint will never be hit. The debugger should deactivate and rebind it.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
