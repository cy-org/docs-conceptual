# CorDebugBlockingReason Enumeration
Specifies the reasons why a thread may become blocked on a given object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Typedef enum CorDebugBlockingReason  
{  
   BLOCKING_NONE = 0  
   BLOCKING_MONITOR_CRITICAL_SECTION = 1  
   BLOCKING_MONITOR_EVENT = 2  
}  CorDebugBlockingReason;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`BLOCKING_NONE`|Internal use only.|  
|`BLOCKING_MONITOR_CRITICAL_SECTION`|A thread is trying to acquire the critical section that is associated with the monitor lock on an object. Typically, this occurs when you call one of the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Enter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Threading.Monitor.TryEnter%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods.|  
|`BLOCKING_MONITOR_EVENT`|A thread is waiting on the event that is associated with a monitor lock for an object. Typically, this occurs when you call one of the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor?displayProperty=fullName>`Wait` methods.|  
  
## Remarks  
 When the `BLOCKING_MONITOR_CRITICAL_SECTION` or `BLOCKING_MONITOR_EVENT` member is used in a [CorDebugBlockingObject](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/cordebugblockingobject-structure.md) structure, the `pBlockingObject` member of the structure points to an "ICorDebugValue" interface that represents the object that is being entered. It is also guaranteed to implement the [ICorDebugHeapValue3](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugheapvalue3-interface.md) interface.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v40plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v40plus-md.md)]
