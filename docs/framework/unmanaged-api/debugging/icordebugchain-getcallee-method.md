# ICorDebugChain::GetCallee Method
Gets the chain that was called by this chain.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetCallee (  
    [out] ICorDebugChain     **ppChain  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `ppChain`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an ICorDebugChain object that represents the called chain. If this chain is currently executing (that is, if this chain is not waiting for a called chain to return), `ppChain` will be null.  
  
## Remarks  
 This chain will wait for the called chain to return before it resumes execution. The called chain may be on another thread in the case of cross-thread marshaled calls.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
