# ResolveTypeLib Method
Resolves the simple name of a type library by returning its fully qualified path.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ResolveTypeLib(  
    [in]  BSTR      bstrSimpleName,  
    [in]  GUID      tlbid,  
    [in]  LCID      lcid,  
    [in]  USHORT    wMajorVersion,  
    [in]  USHORT    wMinorVersion,  
    [in]  SYSKIND   syskind,  
    [out] BSTR     *pbstrResolvedTlbName);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bstrSimpleName`  
 [in] A [BSTR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1b2d7d2c-47af-4389-a6b6-b01b7e915228) that contains the simple name of the type library.  
  
 `tlbid`  
 [in] The GUID assigned to the type library in the registry.  
  
 `lcid`  
 [in] The localization ID of the type library.  
  
 `wMajorVersion`  
 [in] The major version number of the type library. For example, for version *x.y*, the major version number is *x*.  
  
 `wMinorVersion`  
 [in] The minor version number of the type library. For example, for version *x.y*, the minor version number is *y*.  
  
 `syskind`  
 [in] A [SYSKIND](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/662048b2-59a8-48ca-9e4f-2f9a5306faa1) flag that identifies the operating environment. Common values are SYS_WIN32 and SYS_WIN64.  
  
 `pbstrResolvedTlbName`  
 [out] A pointer to a [BSTR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1b2d7d2c-47af-4389-a6b6-b01b7e915228) that contains the full path of the type library named in the `bstrSimpleName` parameter.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `ResolveTypeLib` method is called by the [LoadTypeLibWithResolver function](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/tlbexp/loadtypelibwithresolver-function.md) during [Tlbexp.exe (Type Library Exporter)](../../../../docs/framework/tools/tlbexp-exe-type-library-exporter.md) processing.  
  
 Custom implementations of this interface must return a [BSTR](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1b2d7d2c-47af-4389-a6b6-b01b7e915228) that contains the full path of the type library named in the `bstrSimpleName` parameter.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** TlbRef.idl, TlbRef.h  
  
 **Library:** TlbRef.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]
