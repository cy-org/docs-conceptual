# Unmanaged API Reference
This section includes information on unmanaged APIs that can be used by managed-code-related applications, such as runtime hosts, compilers, disassemblers, obfuscators, debuggers, and profilers.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Common Data Types](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/common-data-types-unmanaged-api-reference.md)  
 Lists the common data types that are used, particularly in the unmanaged profiling and debugging APIs.  
  
 [ALink](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/alink/index.md)  
 Describes the ALink API, which supports the creation of .NET Framework assemblies and unbound modules.  
  
 [Authenticode](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/authenticode/index.md)  
 Supports the Authenticode XrML license creation and verification module.  
  
 [Constants](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/constants-unmanaged-api-reference.md)  
 Describes the constants that are defined in CorSym.idl.  
  
 [Custom Interface Attributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/940952f9-46ad-4a1a-920f-118dc0bdcd9f)  
 Describes component object model (COM) custom interface attributes.  
  
 [Debugging](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/index.md)  
 Describes the debugging API, which enables a debugger to debug code that runs in the common language runtime (CLR) environment.  
  
 [Diagnostics Symbol Store](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/index.md)  
 Describes the diagnostics symbol store API, which enables a compiler to generate symbol information for use by a debugger.  
  
 [Fusion](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/fusion/index.md)  
 Describes the fusion API, which enables a runtime host to access the properties of an application's resources in order to locate the correct versions of those resources for the application.  
  
 [Hosting](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/index.md)  
 Describes the hosting API, which enables unmanaged hosts to integrate the CLR into their applications.  
  
 [Metadata](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/index.md)  
 Describes the metadata API, which enables a client such as a compiler to generate or access a component's metadata without the types being loaded by the CLR.  
  
 [Profiling](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/index.md)  
 Describes the profiling API, which enables a profiler to monitor a program's execution by the CLR.  
  
 [Strong Naming](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/strong-naming/index.md)  
 Describes the strong naming API, which enables a client to administer strong name signing for assemblies.  
  
 [Tlbexp Helper Functions](../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/tlbexp/index.md)  
 Describes the two helper functions and interface used by the Type Library Exporter (Tlbexp.exe) during the assembly-to-type-library conversion process.
