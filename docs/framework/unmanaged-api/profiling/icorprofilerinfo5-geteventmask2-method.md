# ICorProfilerInfo5::GetEventMask2 Method
[Supported in the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and later versions]  
  
 Gets the current event categories for which the profiler wants to receive notifications from the common language runtime (CLR).  It provides functionality not provided by the [ICorProfilerInfo::GetEventMask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-geteventmask-method.md) method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
HRESULT GetEventMask2(  
        [out] DWORD* pdwEventsLow,  
        [out] DWORD* pdwEventsHigh  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pdwEventsLow`  
 [out] A pointer to a 4-byte value that specifies the categories of events. Each bit controls a different capability, behavior, or type of event. The bits are described in the [COR_PRF_MONITOR](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-monitor-enumeration.md) enumeration.  
  
 `pdwEventsHigh`  
 [out] A pointer to a 4-byte value that specifies the categories of events.  Each bit controls a different capability, behavior, or type of event. The bits are described in the [COR_PRF_HIGH_MONITOR](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-high-monitor-enumeration.md) enumeration.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `GetEventMask2` method is used to determine which callbacks the profiler has subscribed to. Typically, you perform a logical OR of the `pdwEventsLow` and `pdwEventsHigh` values and any new bits you want to set, and then call the [SetEventMask2](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo5-seteventmask2-method.md) method.  
  
 This method is the recommended alternative to the [GetEventMask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-geteventmask-method.md) method.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib
