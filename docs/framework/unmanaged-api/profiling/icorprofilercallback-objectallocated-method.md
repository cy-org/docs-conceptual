# ICorProfilerCallback::ObjectAllocated Method
Notifies the profiler that memory within the heap has been allocated for an object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ObjectAllocated(  
    [in] ObjectID objectId,  
    [in] ClassID classId);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `objectId`  
 [in] The ID of the object for which memory was allocated.  
  
 `classId`  
 [in] The ID of the class of which the object is an instance.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `ObjectedAllocated` method is not called for allocations from either the stack or unmanaged memory. The `classId` parameter can refer to a class in managed code that has not been loaded yet. The profiler will receive a class load callback for that class immediately after the `ObjectAllocated` callback.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h  
  
 **Library:** CorGuids.lib  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]
