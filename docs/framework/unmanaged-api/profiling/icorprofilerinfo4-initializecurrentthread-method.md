# ICorProfilerInfo4::InitializeCurrentThread Method
Initializes the current thread in advance of subsequent profiler API calls on the same thread, so that deadlock can be avoided.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT InitializeCurrentThread ();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 We recommend that you call `InitializeCurrentThread` on any thread that will call a profiler API while there are suspended threads. This method is typically used by sampling profilers that create their own thread to call the [ICorProfilerInfo2::DoStackSnapshot](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo2-dostacksnapshot-method.md) method to perform stack walks while the target thread is suspended. By calling `InitializeCurrentThread` once when the profiler first creates the sampling thread, profilers can ensure that lazy per-thread initialization that the CLR would otherwise perform during the first call to `DoStackSnapshot` can now occur safely when no other threads are suspended.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  `InitializeCurrentThread` does the initialization in advance to finish tasks that take locks, and may deadlock. Call `InitializeCurrentThread` only when there are no suspended threads.
