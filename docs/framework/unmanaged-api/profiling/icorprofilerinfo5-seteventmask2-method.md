# ICorProfilerInfo5::SetEventMask2 Method
[Supported in the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and later versions]  
  
 Sets a value that specifies the types of events for which the profiler wants to receive event notifications from the common language runtime (CLR). It provides more functionality than the [ICorProfilerInfo::SetEventMask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-seteventmask-method.md) method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
HRESULT SetEventMask2(        [in] DWORD dwEventsLow,        [in] DWORD dwEventsHigh  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwEventsLow`  
 [in] A 4-byte value that specifies the categories of events. Each bit controls a different capability, behavior, or type of event. The bits are described in the [COR_PRF_MONITOR](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-monitor-enumeration.md) enumeration.  
  
 `dwEventsHigh`  
 [in] A 4-byte value that specifies the categories of events.  Each bit controls a different capability, behavior, or type of event. The bits are described in the [COR_PRF_HIGH_MONITOR](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-high-monitor-enumeration.md) enumeration.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `SetEventMask2` method is used to set the callbacks to which the profiler subscribes. Typically, you call the [GetEventMask2](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo5-geteventmask2-method.md) method to determine which bits are set, perform a logical OR of its `pdwEventsLow` and `pdwEventsHigh` values and any new bits you want to set, and then call the `SetEventMask2` method.  
  
 This method is the recommended alternative to the [SetEventMask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-seteventmask-method.md) method.  
  
## Requirements
