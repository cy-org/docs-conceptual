## Remarks  
 The CLR calls a method in the `ICorProfilerCallback` (or [ICorProfilerCallback2](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback2-interface.md)) interface to notify the profiler when an event, to which the profiler has subscribed, occurs. This is the primary callback interface through which the CLR communicates with the code profiler.  
  
 A code profiler must implement the methods of the `ICorProfilerCallback` interface. For the .NET Framework version 2.0 or later, the profiler must also implement the `ICorProfilerCallback2` methods. Each method implementation must return an HRESULT that has a value of S_OK on success or E_FAIL on failure. Currently, the CLR ignores the HRESULT that is returned by each callback except [ICorProfilerCallback::ObjectReferences](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback-objectreferences-method.md).  
  
 In the Microsoft Windows registry, a code profiler must register its Component Object Model (COM) object that implements the `ICorProfilerCallback` and `ICorProfilerCallback2` interfaces. A code profiler subscribes to the events for which it wants to receive notification by calling [ICorProfilerInfo::SetEventMask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-seteventmask-method.md). This is usually done in the profiler's implementation of [ICorProfilerCallback::Initialize](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback-initialize-method.md). The profiler is then able to receive notification from the runtime when an event is about to occur or has just occurred in an executing runtime process.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The profiler registers a single COM object. If the profiler is targeting the .NET Framework version 1.0 or 1.1, that COM object needs to implement only the methods of `ICorProfilerCallback`. If it is targeting .NET Framework version 2.0 or later, the COM object must also implement the methods of `ICorProfilerCallback2`.
