# IHostCrst::Leave Method
Leaves the critical section that is represented by the current instance of [IHostCrst](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcrst-interface.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Leave ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Leave` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `Leave` allows the CLR to communicate directly with the host's threading implementation, rather than using the corresponding Win32 `LeaveCriticalSection` function. A thread that takes ownership of the critical section represented by the current `IHostCrst` instance must call `Leave` once for each time it enters that critical section.
