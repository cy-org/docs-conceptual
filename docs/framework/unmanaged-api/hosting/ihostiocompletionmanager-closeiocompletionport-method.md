# IHostIoCompletionManager::CloseIoCompletionPort Method
Requests that the host close a port that was opened through an earlier call to [CreateIoCompletionPort](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostiocompletionmanager-createiocompletionport-method.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CloseIoCompletionPort (  
    [in] HANDLE hPort  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `hPort`  
 [in] The handle of the port to close.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CloseIoCompletionPort` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|An invalid port handle was passed.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `hPort` must be a handle to a port that was created by an earlier call to `CreateIoCompletionPort`.
