# ICLRRuntimeInfo::IsLoadable Method
Indicates whether the runtime associated with this interface can be loaded into the current process, taking into account other runtimes that might already be loaded into the process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT IsLoadable(  
        [out, retval] BOOL *pbLoadable);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pbLoadable`  
 [out] `true` if this runtime could be loaded into the current process; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Return Value  
 This method returns the following specific HRESULTs as well as HRESULT errors that indicate method failure.  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The method completed successfully.|  
|E_POINTER|`pbLoadable` is null.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If another runtime is already loaded into the process and the runtime associated with this interface can be loaded for in-process side-by-side execution, `pbLoadable` returns `true`. If the two runtimes cannot run side-by-side in-process, `pbLoadable` returns `false`. For example, the common language runtime (CLR) version 4 can run side-by-side in the same process with CLR version 2.0 or CLR version 1.1. However, CLR version 1.1 and CLR version 2.0 cannot run side-by-side in-process.  
  
 If no runtimes are loaded into the process, this method always returns `true`.
