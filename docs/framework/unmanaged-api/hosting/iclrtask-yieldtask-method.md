# ICLRTask::YieldTask Method
Requests that the common language runtime (CLR) put aside the task that the current [ICLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md) instance represents, and make the processor time available to other tasks.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT YieldTask ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`YieldTask` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A host calls `YieldTask` to request processor resources for other tasks or processes. This method is primarily intended to allow long-running code to give up CPU time. The runtime attempts to put the task that the current `ICLRTask` instance represents in a state where it can yield processing time, but makes no guarantee of success.
