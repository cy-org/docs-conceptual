# IHostTaskManager::Sleep Method
Notifies the host that the current task is going to sleep.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Sleep (  
    [in] DWORD dwMilliseconds,  
    [in] DWORD option  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwMilliseconds`  
 [in] The time interval, in milliseconds, that the thread will sleep.  
  
 `option`  
 [in] One of the [WAIT_OPTION](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/wait-option-enumeration.md) enumeration values, indicating what action the host should take if this action blocks.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Sleep` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR typically calls `IHostTaskManager::Sleep` when <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is called from user code.
