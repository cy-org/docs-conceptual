# IHostThreadPoolManager::GetMaxThreads Method
Gets the maximum number of threads that the host maintains concurrently in the thread pool.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetMaxThreads (  
    [out] DWORD *pdwMaxWorkerThreads  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pdwMaxWorkerThreads`  
 [out] A pointer to the maximum number of threads that the host maintains in the thread pool.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetMaxThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR( has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `GetMaxThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR calls `GetMaxThreads` to determine the total number of threads in the thread pool. The [GetAvailableThreads](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostthreadpoolmanager-getavailablethreads-method.md) method gets the number of threads that are not currently processing work items. All requests above the returned value of the `pdwMaxWorkerThreads` parameter remain queued until threads become available.  
  
 If the host does not provide an implementation of `GetMaxThreads`, it should return an HRESULT value of E_NOTIMPL.
