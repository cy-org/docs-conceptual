# CoInitializeEE Function
Ensures that the common language runtime execution engine is loaded into a process. This function is deprecated in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)]. Use the [ICLRRuntimeHost::Start](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-start-method.md) method instead.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CoInitializeEE (  
   [in] DWORD fFlags  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `fFlags`  
 [in] One of the [COINITIEE](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/coinitiee-enumeration.md) enumeration constants.  
  
## Return Value  
 This method returns standard COM error codes as defined in Winerror.h, and the values in the following table.

|S_OK|The execution engine was loaded successfully.|  
|S_FALSE|The execution engine is already loaded.|  
|E_FAIL|The execution engine could not be loaded.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method loads the execution engine if it has not been previously loaded.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).
