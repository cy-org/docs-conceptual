# ICLRGCManager::Collect Method
Forces a garbage collection for the specified generation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Collect (  
    [in] LONG Generation  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Generation`  
 [in] The generation to collect. A value of -1 forces a collection of all generations.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Collect` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Collect` method forces the CLR's garbage collector to perform a collection regardless of its current state.
