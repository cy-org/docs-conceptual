# IHostSyncManager::CreateCrstWithSpinCount Method
Creates a critical section object with spin count for synchronization.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CreateCrstWithSpinCount (  
    [in]  DWORD dwSpinCount,  
    [out] IHostCrst** ppCrst  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwSpinCount`  
 [in] Specifies the spin count for the critical section object.  
  
 `ppCrst`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an [IHostCrst](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcrst-interface.md) instance, or null if the critical section could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateCrstWithSpinCount` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested critical section.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A spin count is used only on a multi-processor system. The spin count specifies the number of times a calling thread must spin before it performs a wait operation on a semaphore that is associated with an unavailable critical section. If the critical section becomes free during the spin operation, the calling thread avoids the wait operation. `CreateCrstWithSpinCount` mirrors the Win32 `InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount` function.
