# ICorRuntimeHost::Stop Method
Stops the execution of code in the runtime for the current process.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Stop ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The operation was successful.|  
|S_FALSE|The operation failed to complete.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown, catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the common language runtime (CLR) is no longer usable in the process. Subsequent calls to any hosting APIs return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
  
## Remarks  
 It is typically unnecessary to call the `Stop` method, because the code stops executing when the process exits.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  After a call to `Stop`, the CLR cannot be reinitialized into the same process.
