# _CorDllMain Function
Initializes the common language runtime (CLR), locates the managed entry point in the DLL assembly's CLR header, and begins execution.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
BOOL STDMETHODCALLTYPE _CorDllMain (  
   [in] HINSTANCE hInst,  
   [in] DWORD     dwReason,  
   [in] LPVOID    lpReserved  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `hInst`  
 [in] The instance handle of the loaded module.  
  
 `dwReason`  
 [in]Indicates why the DLL entry-point function is being called. This parameter can be one of the following values: DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, DLL_THREAD_ATTACH, DLL_THREAD_ATTACH, or DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. For descriptions of these values, see the `DllMain` documentation in the Platform SDK.  
  
 `lpReserved`  
 [in] Unused.  
  
## Return Value  
 This method returns `true` for success and `false` if an error occurs.  
  
## Remarks  
 This function is called by the operating system loader for DLL assemblies. For executable assemblies, the loader calls the [_CorExeMain](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corexemain-function.md) function instead.  
  
 The operating system loader calls this method regardless of the entry point specified in the DLL file.  
  
 In Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, and Windows 2000, the `_CorDllMain` function is called indirectly through a fixupin the operating system loader. In all other versions of Windows, it is called directly by the operating system loader.  
  
 For additional information, see the Remarks section in the [_CorValidateImage](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corvalidateimage-function.md) topic.
