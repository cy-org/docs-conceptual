# ICLRDebugManager::BeginConnection Method
Establishes a new connection between the host and the debugger to associate a list of tasks with an identifier and a friendly name.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT BeginConnection (  
    [in] CONNID dwConnectionId,  
    [in, string] wchar_t* szConnectionName  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwConnectionId`  
 [in] An identifier to associate with the list of common language runtime (CLR) tasks.  
  
 `szConnectionName`  
 [in] A friendly name to associate with the list of CLR tasks.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`BeginConnection` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|`dwConnectionId` was zero, or `BeginConnection` was already called using this `dwConnectionId` value, or `szConnectionName` was null.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory could be allocated to hold the list of tasks associated with this connection.|  
  
## Remarks  
 [ICLRDebugManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-interface.md) provides three methods, `BeginConnection`, [SetConnectionTasks](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-setconnectiontasks-method.md), and [EndConnection](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-endconnection-method.md), for associating task lists with identifiers and friendly names.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These three methods must be called in a specific order for each set of tasks. `BeginConnection` is called first to establish a new connection. `SetConnectionTasks` is called next to provide the set of tasks to be associated with that connection. `EndConnection` is called last to remove the association between the task list and the identifier and friendly name.However, calls for different connections can be nested.
