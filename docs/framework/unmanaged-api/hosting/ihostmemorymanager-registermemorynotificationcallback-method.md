# IHostMemoryManager::RegisterMemoryNotificationCallback Method
Registers a pointer to a callback function that the host invokes to notify the common language runtime (CLR) of the current memory load on the computer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT RegisterMemoryNotificationCallback (  
    [in] ICLRMemoryNotificationCallback* pCallback  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pCallback`  
 [in] An interface pointer to an [ICLRMemoryNotificationCallback](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrmemorynotificationcallback-interface.md) instance that is implemented by the CLR.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`RegisterMemoryNotificationCallback` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Because the `ICLRMemoryNotificationCallback` interface defines only one method ([ICLRMemoryNotificationCallback::OnMemoryNotification](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrmemorynotificationcallback-onmemorynotification-method.md)), and because `pCallback` is a pointer to an `ICLRMemoryNotificationCallback` instance provided by the CLR, the registration is effectively for the callback function itself. The host invokes `OnMemoryNotification` to report memory pressure conditions, rather than using the standard Win32 `CreateMemoryResourceNotification` function. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Calls to `OnMemoryNotification` never block. They always return immediately.
