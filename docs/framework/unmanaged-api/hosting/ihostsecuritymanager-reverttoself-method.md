# IHostSecurityManager::RevertToSelf Method
Terminates impersonation of the current user identity and returns the original thread token.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT RevertToSelf ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`RevertToSelf` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `RevertToSelf` is called to return to the original thread token, after an earlier call to the [ImpersonateLoggedOnUser](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsecuritymanager-impersonateloggedonuser-method.md) method.
