# IHostTaskManager::EnterRuntime Method
Notifies the host that a call to an unmanaged method, such as a platform invoke method, is returning execution control to the common language runtime (CLR).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT EnterRuntime ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`EnterRuntime` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to complete the requested allocation.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `EnterRuntime` is called to notify the host that an unmanaged function, for which an earlier call to the [LeaveRuntime](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-leaveruntime-method.md) method was made, has finished executing, and is returning execution control to the runtime.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [ReverseEnterRuntime](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-reverseenterruntime-method.md) is called to notify the host that an unmanaged function, for which an earlier call to `LeaveRuntime` was made, is making a call into managed code.
