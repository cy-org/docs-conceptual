# IHostIoCompletionManager::GetMinThreads Method
Gets the minimum number of threads that the host provides for processing I/O requests.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetMinThreads (  
    [out] DWORD *pdwMinIOCompletionThreads  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pdwMinIOCompletionThreads`  
 [out] A pointer to the minimum number of threads that the host provides to process I/O requests.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetMinThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `GetMinThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A host might want exclusive control over the number of threads allotted to service I/O requests, for reasons such as implementation, performance, or scalability. For this reason, the host is not required to implement `GetMinThreads`. In this case, the host should return E_NOTIMPL from this method.
