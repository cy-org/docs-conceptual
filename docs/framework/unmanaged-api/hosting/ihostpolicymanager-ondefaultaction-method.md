# IHostPolicyManager::OnDefaultAction Method
Notifies the host that the common language runtime (CLR) is about to take the default action that was set by a call to the [ICLRPolicyManager::SetDefaultAction](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrpolicymanager-setdefaultaction-method.md) method in response to a thread abort or <xref:System.AppDomain> unload.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT OnDefaultAction (  
    [in] EClrOperation  operation,   
    [in] EPolicyAction  action  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `operation`  
 [in] One of the [EClrOperation](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/eclroperation-enumeration.md) values, indicating the kind of event to which the CLR is responding.  
  
 `action`  
 [in] One of the [EPolicyAction](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/epolicyaction-enumeration.md) values, indicating the action that the CLR is taking in response to the event.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`OnDefaultAction` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call. successfully|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|
