# IHostThreadPoolManager::GetAvailableThreads Method
Gets the number of threads in the thread pool that are not currently processing work items.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetAvailableThreads (  
    [out] DWORD *pdwAvailableWorkerThreads  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pdwAvailableWorkerThreads`  
 [out] Pointer to the number of threads in the thread pool that are not currently processing work items.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetAvailableThreads` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not provide an implementation of `GetAvailableThreads`.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If the host does not provide an implementation of `GetAvailableThreads`, it should return an HRESULT value of E_NOTIMPL.
