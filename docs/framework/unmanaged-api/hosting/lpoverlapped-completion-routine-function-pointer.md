# LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer
Points to a function that notifies the host when an overlapped (that is, asynchronous) I/O to a device has completed.  
  
 This function pointer has been deprecated in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)].  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef VOID (*LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) (  
    [in] DWORD  dwErrorCode,  
    [in] DWORD  dwNumberOfBytesTransfered,  
    [in] LPVOID lpOverlapped  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwErrorCode`  
 [in] A value that is an error code if the device has been closed; otherwise, this value is zero.  
  
 Closing a device causes all pending I/O to the device to be completed immediately.  
  
 `dwNumberOfBytesTransfered`  
 [in] The number of bytes transferred by the I/O operation.  
  
 `lpOverlapped`  
 [in] A pointer to a structure that contains information to be used to complete the I/O request.  
  
## Remarks  
 The function to which `LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE` points is a callback function and must be implemented by the writer of the hosting application. The callback function allows the host to process the completed I/O request.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MSCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** MSCorWks.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
