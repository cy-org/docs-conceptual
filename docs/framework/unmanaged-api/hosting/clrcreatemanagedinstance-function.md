# ClrCreateManagedInstance Function
Creates an instance of the specified managed type.  
  
 This function has been deprecated in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)]. Use COM activation to create an instance of the managed type, or use hosting (see [CLR Hosting Interfaces Added in the .NET Framework 4 and 4.5](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/clr-hosting-interfaces-added-in-the-net-framework-4-and-4-5.md)).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
STDAPI ClrCreateManagedInstance (  
    [in]  LPCWSTR  pTypeName,   
    [in]  REFIID   riid,   
    [out] void     **ppObject  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pTypeName`  
 [in] A pointer to the name of the instance type being requested.  
  
 `riid`  
 [in] The `IID` of the instance type being requested.  
  
 `ppObject`  
 [out] A pointer to a pointer to an instance of the managed type that was requested by the caller.  
  
## Remarks  
 The common language runtime should already be loaded into a process. For example, it can be loaded by using a call to the [CorBindToRuntimeEx](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corbindtoruntimeex-function.md) function before the `ClrCreateManagedInstance` function is called. If the runtime is not loaded, `ClrCreateManagedInstance` first tries to load v1.0.3705 of the runtime. If that fails, it attempts to load the latest version of the runtime.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MSCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** MSCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
