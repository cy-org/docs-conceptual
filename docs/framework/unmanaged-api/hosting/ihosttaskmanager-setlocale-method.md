# IHostTaskManager::SetLocale Method
Notifies the host that the common language runtime (CLR) has changed the locale, or culture, on the currently executing task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SetLocale (  
    [in] LCID lcid  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lcid`  
 [in] The locale identifier value that maps to the newly assigned geographical culture and language.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetLocale` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_NOTIMPL|The host does not allow managed user code to modify the locale.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The runtime calls `SetLocale` when the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentCulture%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is changed by managed code. This method provides an opportunity for the host to execute any mechanisms it might have for synchronization of locales. If a host does not allow the locale to be changed from managed code, or does not implement a mechanism to synchronize locales, it should return E_NOTIMPL from this method.
