# IHostCrst::TryEnter Method
Attempts to enter the critical section represented by the current [IHostCrst](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcrst-interface.md) instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT TryEnter (  
    [in]  DWORD  option,  
    [out] BOOL   *pbSucceeded  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `option`  
 [in] One of the [WAIT_OPTION](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/wait-option-enumeration.md) values, indicating what action the host should take if the operation blocks.  
  
 `pbSucceeded`  
 [out] `true` if the critical section can be entered; otherwise, `false`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`TryEnter` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `TryEnter` returns immediately and indicates whether the calling thread entered the critical section. This method mirrors the Wind32 `TryEnterCriticalSection` function.
