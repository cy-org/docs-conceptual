# IHostCrst::SetSpinCount Method
Sets the spin count for the current [IHostCrst](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcrst-interface.md) instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SetSpinCount (  
    [in] DWORD dwSpinCount  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwSpinCount`  
 [in] The new spin count for the current `IHostCrst` instance.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetSpinCount` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 On multi-processor systems, if the critical section represented by the current `IHostCrst` instance is unavailable, a calling thread spins `dwSpinCount` times before calling [IHostSemaphore::Wait](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsemaphore-wait-method.md) on a semaphore associated with the critical section. If the critical section becomes free during the spin operation, the calling thread avoids the wait operation.  
  
 The usage of `dwSpinCount` is identical to the usage of the parameter of the same name in the Win32 `InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount` function.
