# ICLRRuntimeHost::UnloadAppDomain Method
Unloads the managed <xref:System.AppDomain> that corresponds to the specified numeric identifier.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT UnloadAppDomain(  
    [in] DWORD dwAppDomainId  
    [in] BOOL  fWaitUntilDone  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwAppDomainId`  
 [in] The numeric identifier of the application domain to unload.  
  
 `fWaitUntilDone`  
 [in] `true` to indicate that the common language runtime( CLR) must wait until it has finished executing the application's current thread before attempting to unload the application domain.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`UnloadAppDomain` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 You can get the numeric identifier of the application domain in which the current thread is executing by calling [GetCurrentAppDomainId](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-getcurrentappdomainid-method.md). This identifier corresponds to the <xref:System.AppDomain.Id%2A> property of the managed <xref:System.AppDomain> type.
