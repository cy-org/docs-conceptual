# IHostSyncManager::CreateCrst Method
Creates a critical section object for synchronization.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CreateCrst (  
    [out] IHostCrst** ppCrst  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `ppCrst`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an [IHostCrst](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcrst-interface.md) instance implemented by the host, or null if the critical section could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateCrst` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested critical section.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Critical section objects provide synchronization similar to that provided by a mutex object, except that critical sections can be used only by the threads of a single process. `CreateCrst` mirrors the Win32 `InitializeCriticalSection` function.  
  
## Requirements
