# ICLRTask::SetTaskIdentifier Method
Instructs the common language runtime (CLR) to associate the specified identifier value with the task represented by the current [ICLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md) instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SetTaskIdentifier (  
    [in] DWORD Asked  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Asked`  
 [in] The unique identifier for the common language runtime to associate with the task represented by the current `ICLRTask` instance.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetTaskIdentifier` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The host can associate an identifier with a task to help integrate the CLR and the host in a debugging environment. The identifier has no meaning for the CLR. The CLR passes it along to a debugger application. The debugger can use this identifier to associate a CLR call stack with a host call stack, and enable their respective trace information to be unified when viewed in the debugger's user interface.
