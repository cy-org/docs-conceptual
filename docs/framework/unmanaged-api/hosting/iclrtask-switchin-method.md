# ICLRTask::SwitchIn Method
Notifies the common language runtime (CLR) that the task that the current [ICLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md) instance represents is now in an operable state.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SwitchIn (  
    [in] HANDLE threadHandle  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `threadHandle`  
 [in] A handle to the physical thread on which the task represented by the current `ICLRTask` instance is executing.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SwitchIn` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION|`SwitchIn` was called without an earlier call to [SwitchOut Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-switchout-method.md).|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `threadHandle` parameter represents a handle to the operating system thread on which the task represented by the current `ICLRTask` instance has been scheduled. If impersonation has occurred on this thread, you must call [IHostSecurityManager::RevertToSelf](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsecuritymanager-reverttoself-method.md) before switching in the task.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  A call to `SwitchIn` without an earlier call to `SwitchOut` fails with an HRESULT value of HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION.
