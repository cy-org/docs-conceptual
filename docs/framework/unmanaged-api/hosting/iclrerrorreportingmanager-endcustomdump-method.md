# ICLRErrorReportingManager::EndCustomDump Method
Removes the custom stack dump configuration that was specified in an earlier call to the [ICLRErrorReportingManager::BeginCustomDump](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrerrorreportingmanager-begincustomdump-method.md) method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT EndCustomDump ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`EndCustomDump` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `EndCustomDump` method clears the custom stack dump configuration set by an earlier call to the `BeginCustomDump` method and frees any associated state. It should be called after the custom stack dump is complete.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Failure to call `EndCustomDump` causes memory to leak.
