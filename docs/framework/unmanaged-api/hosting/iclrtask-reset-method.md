# ICLRTask::Reset Method
Informs the common language runtime (CLR) that the host has completed a task, and enables the CLR to reuse the current [ICLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md) instance to represent another task.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Reset (  
    [in] BOOL fFull  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `fFull`  
 [in] `true`, if the runtime should reset all thread-related static values in addition to the security and locale information related to the current `ICLRTask` instance; otherwise, `false`.  
  
 If the value is `true`, the runtime resets data that was stored using <xref:System.Threading.Thread.AllocateDataSlot%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Thread.AllocateNamedDataSlot%2A>.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Reset` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call. successfully|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR can recycle previously created `ICLRTask` instances to avoid the overhead of repeatedly creating new instances every time it needs a fresh task. The host enables this feature by calling `ICLRTask::Reset` instead of [ICLRTask::ExitTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-exittask-method.md) when it has completed a task. The following list summarizes the normal life cycle of an `ICLRTask` instance:  
  
1.  The runtime creates a new `ICLRTask` instance.  
  
2.  The runtime calls [IHostTaskManager::GetCurrentTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-getcurrenttask-method.md) to get a reference to the current host task.  
  
3.  The runtime calls [IHostTask::SetCLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-setclrtask-method.md) to associate the new instance with the host task.  
  
4.  The task executes and completes.  
  
5.  The host destroys the task by calling `ICLRTask::ExitTask`.  
  
 `Reset` alters this scenario in two ways. In step 5 above, the host calls `Reset` to reset the task to a clean state, and then decouples the `ICLRTask` instance from its associated [IHostTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md) instance. If desired, the host can also cache the `IHostTask` instance for reuse. In step 1 above, the runtime pulls a recycled `ICLRTask` from the cache instead of creating a new instance.  
  
 This approach works well when the host also has a pool of reusable worker tasks. When the host destroys one of its `IHostTask` instances, it destroys the corresponding `ICLRTask` by calling `ExitTask`.
