# IHostMalloc Interface
Provides methods that allow the common language runtime (CLR) to request fine-grained allocations from the heap through the host.  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|[Alloc Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmalloc-alloc-method.md)|Requests that the host allocate the requested amount of memory from the heap.|  
|[DebugAlloc Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmalloc-debugalloc-method.md)|Requests that the host allocate the requested amount of memory from the heap, and additionally track where the memory was allocated.|  
|[Free Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmalloc-free-method.md)|Frees memory that was allocated by using the `Alloc` method.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR gets an interface pointer to an `IHostMalloc` instance by calling the [IHostMemoryManager::CreateMalloc](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-createmalloc-method.md) method.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** MSCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]
