# _CorExeMain Function
Initializes the common language runtime (CLR), locates the managed entry point in the executable assembly's CLR header, and begins execution.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
__int32 STDMETHODCALLTYPE _CorExeMain ();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This function is called by the loader in processes created from managed executable assemblies. For DLL assemblies, the loader calls the [_CorDllMain](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/cordllmain-function.md) function instead.  
  
 The operating system loader calls this method regardless of the entry point specified in the image file.  
  
 In Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, and Windows 2000, the `_CorExeMain` function is called indirectly through a fixup in the operating system loader. In all other versions of Windows, it is called directly by the operating system loader.  
  
 For additional information, see the Remarks section in the [_CorValidateImage](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corvalidateimage-function.md) topic.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  
  
 **Header:** Cor.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MsCorEE.dll  
  
 **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]
