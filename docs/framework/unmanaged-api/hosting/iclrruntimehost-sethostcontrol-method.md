# ICLRRuntimeHost::SetHostControl Method
Sets the interface pointer that the common language runtime (CLR) can use to get the host's implementation of [IHostControl Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcontrol-interface.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT SetHostControl(  
    [in] IHostControl* pHostControl  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pHostControl`  
 [in] An interface pointer to the host's implementation of [IHostControl Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostcontrol-interface.md).  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`SetHostControl` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_CLR_ALREADY_STARTED|The CLR has already been initialized.|  
  
## Remarks  
 You must call `SetHostControl` before the CLR is initialized, that is, before you call [Start Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-start-method.md) or use any of the [Metadata Interfaces](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/metadata-interfaces.md). It is recommended that you call `SetHostControl` immediately after calling [CorBindToCurrentRuntime Function](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corbindtocurrentruntime-function.md) or [CorBindToRuntimeEx Function](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corbindtoruntimeex-function.md).
