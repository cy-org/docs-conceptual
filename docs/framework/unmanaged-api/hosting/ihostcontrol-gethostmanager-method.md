# IHostControl::GetHostManager Method
Gets an interface pointer to the host's implementation of the interface with the specified `IID`.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetHostManager (  
    [in] REFIID riid,  
    [out, iid_is(riid)] void** ppObject  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `riid`  
 [in] The `IID` of the interface that the common language runtime (CLR) is querying for.  
  
 `ppObject`  
 [out] A pointer to the host-implemented interface, or null if the host does not support this interface.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetHostManager` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|The requested `IID` is not valid.|  
|E_NOINTERFACE|The requested interface is not supported.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR queries the host to determine whether it supports one or more of the following interfaces:  
  
-   [IHostMemoryManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostTaskManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostThreadPoolManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostthreadpoolmanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostIoCompletionManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostiocompletionmanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostSyncManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsyncmanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostAssemblyManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostassemblymanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostGCManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostgcmanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostPolicyManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostpolicymanager-interface.md)  
  
-   [IHostSecurityManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsecuritymanager-interface.md)  
  
 If the host supports the specified interface, it sets `ppObject` to its implementation of that interface. Otherwise, it sets `ppObject` to null.  
  
 The CLR does not call `Release` on host managers, even when you shut it down.
