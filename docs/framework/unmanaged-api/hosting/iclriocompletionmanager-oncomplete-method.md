# ICLRIoCompletionManager::OnComplete Method
Notifies the common language runtime (CLR) of the status of an I/O request that was made by using a call to the [IHostIoCompletionManager::Bind](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostiocompletionmanager-bind-method.md) method.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT OnComplete (  
    [in] DWORD dwErrorCode,  
    [in] DWORD NumberOfBytesTransferred,  
    [in] void* pvOverlapped  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwErrorCode`  
 [in] An HRESULT value that indicates the status of the bind operation.  
  
-   S_OK indicates that the operation completed successfully.  
  
-   HOST_E_INTERRUPTED indicates that the call terminated before completion.  
  
-   E_FAIL indicates that an unknown, unrecoverable, catastrophic failure occurred.  
  
 `NumberOfBytesTransferred`  
 [in] The number of bytes transferred during the processing of the I/O request.  
  
 `pvOverlapped`  
 [in] A pointer to the `OVERLAPPED` structure that was passed to the call to the `IHostIoCompletionManager::Bind` method.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`OnComplete` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If the host implements an I/O completion abstraction, the CLR makes I/O requests through the host by using methods of [IHostIoCompletionManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostiocompletionmanager-interface.md). The host then calls the `OnComplete` method to notify the runtime of the outcome of such requests.
