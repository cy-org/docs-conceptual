# IHostGCManager::ThreadIsBlockingForSuspension Method
Notifies the host that the thread from which the method call was made is about to block for a garbage collection.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ThreadIsBlockingForSuspension ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`ThreadIsBlockingForSuspension` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR typically calls the `ThreadIsBlockForSuspension` method in preparation for a garbage collection, to give the host an opportunity to reschedule the thread for unmanaged tasks.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The host can reschedule tasks only after a call to `ThreadIsBlockingForSuspension`. After the runtime calls [SuspensionStarting](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostgcmanager-suspensionstarting-method.md), the host must not reschedule a task.  
  
## Requirements
