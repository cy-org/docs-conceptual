# ICLRDebugManager::EndConnection Method
Removes the association between a list of tasks and an identifier and a friendly name.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT EndConnection (  
    [in] CONNID dwConnectionId  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `dwConnectionId`  
 [in] The host-specific identifier for the connection and the associated list of common language runtime (CLR) tasks.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`EndConnection` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_INVALIDARG|[BeginConnection](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-beginconnection-method.md) was never called using `dwConnectionId`, or `dwConnectionId` was zero.|  
  
## Remarks  
 [ICLRDebugManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-interface.md) provides three methods, `BeginConnection`, [SetConnectionTasks](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-setconnectiontasks-method.md), and `EndConnection`, for associating task lists with identifiers and friendly names.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  These three methods must be called in a specific order for each set of tasks. `BeginConnection` is called first to establish a new connection. `SetConnectionTasks` is called next to provide the set of tasks to be associated with that connection. `EndConnection` is called last to remove the association between the task list and the identifier and friendly name.However, calls for different connections can be nested.
