# IHostSyncManager::CreateMonitorEvent Method
Creates a monitored auto-reset event object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CreateMonitorEvent (  
    [in]  SIZE_T cookie,  
    [out] IHostAutoEvent **ppEvent  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `cookie`  
 [in] A cookie to associate with the event object.  
  
 `ppEvent`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of an [IHostAutoEvent](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostautoevent-interface.md) instance, or null if the event object could not be created.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`CreateMonitorEvent` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested event object.|  
  
## Remarks  
 `CreateMonitorEvent` returns an `IHostAutoEvent` that the CLR uses in its implementation of the managed <xref:System.Threading.Monitor?displayProperty=fullName> type. This method mirrors the Win32 `CreateEvent` function, with a value of `false` specified for the `bManualReset` parameter.  
  
 The host can use the cookie to determine which task is waiting on the monitor by calling the [ICLRSyncManager::GetMonitorOwner](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrsyncmanager-getmonitorowner-method.md) method.
