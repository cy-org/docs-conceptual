# ICLRSyncManager::GetRWLockOwnerNext Method
Gets the next [IHostTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md) instance that is blocked on the current reader-writer lock.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT GetRWLockOwnerNext (  
    [in] SIZE_T       Iterator,  
    [out] IHostTask  *ppOwnerHostTask  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Iterator`  
 [in] The iterator that was created by using a call to [CreateRWLockOwnerIterator](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrsyncmanager-createrwlockowneriterator-method.md).  
  
 `ppOwnerHostTask`  
 [out] A pointer to the next `IHostTask` that is waiting on the lock, or null if no task is waiting.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`GetRWLockOwnerNext` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 If `ppOwnerHostTask` is set to null, the iteration has terminated, and the host should call the [DeleteRWLockOwnerIterator](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrsyncmanager-deleterwlockowneriterator-method.md) method.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The CLR calls `AddRef` on the `IHostTask` to which `ppOwnerHostTask` points to prevent this task from exiting while the host holds the pointer. The host must call `Release` to decrement the reference count when it is finished.
