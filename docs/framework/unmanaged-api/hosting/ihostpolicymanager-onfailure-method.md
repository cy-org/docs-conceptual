# IHostPolicyManager::OnFailure Method
Notifies the host that the common language runtime (CLR) is about to take the action specified by a call to the [ICLRPolicyManager::SetActionOnFailure](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrpolicymanager-setactiononfailure-method.md) method in response to a resource allocation or reclamation failure.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT OnFailure(  
    [in] EClrFailure   failure,  
    [in] EPolicyAction action  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `failure`  
 [in] One of the [EClrFailure](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/eclrfailure-enumeration.md) values, indicating the kind of failure to which the CLR is responding.  
  
 `action`  
 [in] One of the [EPolicyAction](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/epolicyaction-enumeration.md) values, indicating the action the CLR is taking in response to `failure`.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`OnFailure` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|
