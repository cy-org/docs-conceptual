# IHostTask::Join Method
Blocks the calling task until the task represented by the current [IHostTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md) instance completes, the specified time interval elapses, or [IHostTask::Alert](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-alert-method.md) is called.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Join (  
    [in] DWORD milliseconds,  
    [in] DWORD option  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `milliseconds`  
 [in] The time interval, in milliseconds, to wait for the task to terminate. If this interval elapses before the task terminates, the calling task unblocks.  
  
 `option`  
 [in] One of the [WAIT_OPTION](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/wait-option-enumeration.md) values. A value of WAIT_ALERTABLE instructs the host to wake the task if `Alert` is called before `milliseconds` elapses.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Join` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it, or the current `IHostTask` instance is not associated with a task.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|
