# ICorRuntimeHost::CurrentDomain Method
Gets an interface pointer of type <xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=fullName> that represents the domain loaded on the current thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT CurrentDomain (  
    [out] IUnknown** pAppDomain  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pAppDomain`  
 [out] A pointer of type <xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=fullName> that represents the thread's current application domain. This pointer is typed `IUnknown`, so callers should generally call `QueryInterface` to obtain a pointer of type <xref:System._AppDomain>.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|The operation was successful.|  
|S_FALSE|The operation failed to complete.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown, catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the common language runtime (CLR) is no longer usable in the process. Subsequent calls to any hosting APIs return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|
