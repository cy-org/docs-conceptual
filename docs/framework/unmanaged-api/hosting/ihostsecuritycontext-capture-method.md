# IHostSecurityContext::Capture Method
Gets a clone of the [IHostSecurityContext](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsecuritycontext-interface.md) instance returned from a call to [IHostSecurityManager::GetSecurityContext](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsecuritymanager-getsecuritycontext-method.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT Capture (  
    [out] IHostSecurityContext** ppClonedContext  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `ppClonedContext`  
 [out] A pointer to the address of a clone of the `IHostSecurityContext` object to be captured.  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`Capture` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The interface pointer returned from `Capture` is a clone of the captured context. When this information is moved across an asynchronous code point, its lifetime is separated from that of the pointer against which the call was made. The original pointer can therefore be released.
