# IHostTaskManager::ReverseLeaveRuntime Method
Notifies the host that control is leaving the common language runtime (CLR) and entering an unmanaged function that was, in turn, called from managed code.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
HRESULT ReverseLeaveRuntime ();  
```  
  
## Return Value  
  
|HRESULT|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|S_OK|`ReverseLeaveRuntime` returned successfully.|  
|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  
|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  
|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  
|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  
|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory is available to complete the requested resource allocation.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The CLR calls `ReverseLeaveRuntime` to inform the host that the currently executing task is returning control to an unmanaged function that was, in turn, called from managed code through platform invoke. Each call to `ReverseLeaveRuntime` matches a corresponding call to [ReverseEnterRuntime](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-reverseenterruntime-method.md).  
  
## Requirements
