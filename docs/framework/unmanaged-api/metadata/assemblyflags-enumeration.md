# AssemblyFlags Enumeration
Contains values that describe run-time features of an assembly.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
typedef enum {  
    afImplicitExportedTypes = 0x0001,  
    afImplicitResources = 0x0002,  
    afNonSideBySideAppDomain = 0x0010,  
    afNonSideBySideProcess = 0x0020,  
    afNonSideBySideMachine = 0x0030  
} AssemblyFlags;  
```  
  
## Members  
  
|Member|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|`afImplicitExportedTypes`|Specifies that exported type definitions are implicit within the files that comprise the assembly. In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, this value is always assumed to be set.|  
|`afImplicitResources`|Specifies that resource definitions are implicit within the files that comprise the assembly. In the .NET Framework 1.0 and 1.1, this value is always assumed to be set.|  
|`afNonSideBySideAppDomain`|Specifies that the assembly cannot execute with other versions if they are running in the same application domain.|  
|`afNonSideBySideProcess`|Specifies that the assembly cannot execute with other versions if they are running in the same process.|  
|`afNonSideBySideMachine`|Specifies that the assembly cannot execute with other versions if they are running on the same computer.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The values between 0x0010 and 0x0070, inclusive, are used to describe side-by-side compatibility features of the referenced assembly. If none of these values are set, the assembly is assumed to be side-by-side compatible.  
  
## Requirements

 **Header:** MsCorEE.h  
  
 **Library:** Included as a resource in MsCorEE.dll
