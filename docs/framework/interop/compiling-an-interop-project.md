# Compiling an Interop Project
COM interop projects that reference one or more assemblies containing imported COM types are compiled like any other managed project. You can reference interop assemblies in a development environment such as Visual Studio, or you can reference them when you use a command-line compiler. In either case, to compile properly, the interop assembly must be in the same directory as the other project files.  
  
 There are two ways to reference interop assemblies:  
  
-   Embedded interop types: Beginning with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../../../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)], you can instruct the compiler to embed type information from an interop assembly into your executable. This is the recommended technique.  
  
-   Deploying interop assemblies: You can create a standard reference to an interop assembly. In this case, the interop assembly must be deployed with your application.  
  
 The differences between these two techniques are discussed in greater detail in [Using COM Types in Managed Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1a95a8ca-c8b8-4464-90b0-5ee1a1135b66).  
  
 Embedding interop types with Visual Studio is demonstrated in [Walkthrough: Embedding Type Information from Microsoft Office Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/85b55e05-bc5e-4665-b6ae-e1ada9299fd3) and [Walkthrough: Embedding Types from Managed Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b28ec92c-1867-4847-95c0-61adfe095e21).  
  
 To reference an interop assembly with a command-line compiler and embed type information in your executables, use the [/link (C# Compiler Options)](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/link-compiler-option.md) or the [/link (Visual Basic)](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/link.md) compiler switch and specify the name of the interop assembly.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Visual C++ applications cannot embed type information, but they can interoperate with applications or add-ins that do.  
  
 To compile an application that includes a primary interop assembly when it is deployed, use the **/reference** compiler switch and specify the name of the interop assembly.
