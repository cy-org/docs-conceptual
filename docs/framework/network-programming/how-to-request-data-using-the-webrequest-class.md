# How to: Request Data Using the WebRequest Class
The following procedure describes the steps used to request a resource from a server, for example, a Web page or file. The resource must be identified by a URI.  
  
### To request data from a host server  
  
1.  Create a <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> instance by calling <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.Create%2A> with the URI of the resource.  
  
    ```csharp  
    WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com/");  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim request as WebRequest = WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com/")  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The .NET Framework provides protocol-specific classes derived from **WebRequest** and **WebResponse** for URIs that begin with "http:", "https:'', "ftp:", and "file:". To access resources using other protocols, you must implement protocol-specific classes that derive from **WebRequest** and **WebResponse**. For more information, see [Programming Pluggable Protocols](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/programming-pluggable-protocols.md) .  
  
2.  Set any property values that you need in the **WebRequest**. For example, to enable authentication, set the **Credentials** property to an instance of the <xref:System.Net.NetworkCredential> class.  
  
    ```csharp  
    request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials  
    ```  
  
     In most cases, the **WebRequest** class is sufficient to receive data. However, if you need to set protocol-specific properties, you must cast the **WebRequest** to the protocol-specific type. For example, to access the HTTP-specific properties of <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest>, cast the **WebRequest** to an **HttpWebRequest** reference. The following code example shows how to set the HTTP-specific <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.UserAgent%2A> property.  
  
    ```csharp  
    ((HttpWebRequest)request).UserAgent = ".NET Framework Example Client";  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Ctype(request,HttpWebRequest).UserAgent = ".NET Framework Example Client"  
    ```  
  
3.  To send the request to the server, call <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse%2A>. The actual type of the returned **WebResponse** object is determined by the scheme of the requested URI.  
  
    ```csharp  
    WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim response As WebResponse = request.GetResponse()  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  After you are finished with a <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> object, you must close it by calling the <xref:System.Net.WebResponse.Close%2A> method. Alternatively, if you have gotten the response stream from the response object, you can close the stream by calling the <xref:System.IO.Stream.Close%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. If you do not close either the response or the stream, your application can run out of connections to the server and become unable to process additional requests.  
  
4.  You can access the properties of the **WebResponse** or cast the **WebResponse** to a protocol-specific instance to read protocol-specific properties. For example, to access the HTTP-specific properties of <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse>, cast the **WebResponse** to a **HttpWebResponse** reference. The following code example shows how to display the status information sent with a response.  
  
    ```csharp  
    Console.WriteLine (((HttpWebResponse)response).StatusDescription);  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Console.WriteLine(CType(response,HttpWebResponse).StatusDescription)  
    ```  
  
5.  To get the stream containing response data sent by the server, use the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse.GetResponseStream%2A> method of the **WebResponse**.  
  
    ```csharp  
    Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream ();  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim dataStream As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()  
    ```  
  
6.  After reading the data from the response, you must either close the response stream using the **Stream.Close** method or close the response using the **WebResponse.Close** method. It is not necessary to call the **Close** method on both the response stream and the **WebResponse**, but doing so is not harmful. **WebResponse.Close** calls **Stream.Close** when closing the response.  
  
    ```csharp  
    response.Close();  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    response.Close()  
    ```  
  
## Example  
  
```csharp  
using System;  
using System.IO;  
using System.Net;  
using System.Text;  
  
namespace Examples.System.Net  
{  
    public class WebRequestGetExample  
    {  
        public static void Main ()  
        {  
            // Create a request for the URL.   
            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create (  
              "http://www.contoso.com/default.html");  
            // If required by the server, set the credentials.  
            request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;  
            // Get the response.  
            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse ();  
            // Display the status.  
            Console.WriteLine (((HttpWebResponse)response).StatusDescription);  
            // Get the stream containing content returned by the server.  
            Stream dataStream = response.GetResponseStream ();  
            // Open the stream using a StreamReader for easy access.  
            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader (dataStream);  
            // Read the content.  
            string responseFromServer = reader.ReadToEnd ();  
            // Display the content.  
            Console.WriteLine (responseFromServer);  
            // Clean up the streams and the response.  
            reader.Close ();  
            response.Close ();  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
```vb  
Imports System  
Imports System.IO  
Imports System.Net  
Imports System.Text  
Namespace Examples.System.Net  
    Public Class WebRequestGetExample  
  
        Public Shared Sub Main()  
            ' Create a request for the URL.   
            Dim request As WebRequest = _  
              WebRequest.Create("http://www.contoso.com/default.html")  
            ' If required by the server, set the credentials.  
            request.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials  
            ' Get the response.  
            Dim response As WebResponse = request.GetResponse()  
            ' Display the status.  
            Console.WriteLine(CType(response,HttpWebResponse).StatusDescription)  
            ' Get the stream containing content returned by the server.  
            Dim dataStream As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()  
            ' Open the stream using a StreamReader for easy access.  
            Dim reader As New StreamReader(dataStream)  
            ' Read the content.  
            Dim responseFromServer As String = reader.ReadToEnd()  
            ' Display the content.  
            Console.WriteLine(responseFromServer)  
            ' Clean up the streams and the response.  
            reader.Close()  
            response.Close()  
        End Sub   
    End Class   
End Namespace  
```
