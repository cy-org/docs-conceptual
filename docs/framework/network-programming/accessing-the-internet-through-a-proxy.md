# Accessing the Internet Through a Proxy
If your site uses a proxy to provide access to the Internet, you must configure a proxy instance to enable your application to communicate with the Web proxy.  
  
 This section includes the following topics:  
  
-   [Proxy Configuration](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/proxy-configuration.md)  
  
-   [Automatic Proxy Detection](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/automatic-proxy-detection.md)  
  
-   [How to: Enable a WebRequest to Use a Proxy to Communicate With the Internet](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-enable-a-webrequest-to-use-a-proxy-to-communicate-with-the-internet.md)  
  
-   [How to: Override a Global Proxy Selection](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-override-a-global-proxy-selection.md)
