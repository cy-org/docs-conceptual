# Creating Internet Requests
Applications create <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> instances through the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. This is a static method that creates a class derived from **WebRequest** based on the URI scheme passed to it.  
  
## Web, File and FTP Requests  
 The .NET Framework provides the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest> class, which is derived from **WebRequest**, to handle HTTP and HTTPS requests. In most cases, the **WebRequest** class provides all the properties you need to make a request; however, if necessary, you can cast **WebRequest** objects created by the **WebRequest.Create** method to the **HttpWebRequest** type to access the HTTP-specific properties of the request. Similarly, the **HttpWebResponse** object handles the responses from HTTP and HTTPS requests. To access the HTTP-specific properties of the **HttpWebResponse** object, you need to cast **WebResponse** objects to the **HttpWebResponse** type.  
  
 The .NET Framework also provides the <xref:System.Net.FileWebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.FileWebResponse> classes to handle requests for resources that use the "file:" URI scheme. Likewise, the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.FtpWebResponse> classes are provided to handle requests for resources that use the "ftp:" scheme. If your request is for a resource that uses any of these schemes, you can use the **WebRequest.Create** method to obtain an object with which to make your request.  
  
 To handle requests that use other application-level protocols, you need to implement protocol-specific classes derived from **WebRequest** and **WebResponse**. For more information, see [Programming Pluggable Protocols](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/programming-pluggable-protocols.md).
