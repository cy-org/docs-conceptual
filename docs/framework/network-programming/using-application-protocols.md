# Using Application Protocols
The .NET Framework supports commonly used Internet application protocols. This section includes information on using the [HTTP](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/http.md), "TCP", and "UDP" protocols, as well as information on using the [Windows Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/sockets.md) interface to implement custom protocols.
