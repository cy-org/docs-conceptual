# Programming Pluggable Protocols
The abstract <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> classes provide the base for pluggable protocols. By deriving protocol-specific classes from <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse>, an application can request data from an Internet resource and read the response without specifying the protocol being used.  
  
 Before you can create a protocol-specific <xref:System.Net.WebRequest>, you must register its Create method. Use the static <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.RegisterPrefix%28System.String%2CSystem.Net.IWebRequestCreate%29> method of <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> to register a <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> descendant to handle a set of requests to a particular Internet scheme, to a scheme and server, or to a scheme, server, and path.  
  
 In most cases you will be able to send and receive data using the methods and properties of the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> class. However, if you need to access protocol-specific properties, you can typecast a <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> to a specific derived-class instance.  
  
 To take advantage of pluggable protocols, your <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> descendants must provide a default request-and-response transaction that does not require protocol-specific properties to be set. For example, the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest> class, which implements the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> class for HTTP, provides a `GET` request by default and returns an <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse> that contains the stream returned from the Web server.
