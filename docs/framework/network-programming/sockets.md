# Sockets
The <xref:System.Net.Sockets> namespace contains a managed implementation of the Windows Sockets interface. All other network-access classes in the <xref:System.Net> namespace are built on top of this implementation of sockets.  
  
 The .NET Framework <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class is a managed-code version of the socket services provided by the Winsock32 API. In most cases, the **Socket** class methods simply marshal data into their native Win32 counterparts and handle any necessary security checks.  
  
 The **Socket** class supports two basic modes, synchronous and asynchronous. In synchronous mode, calls to functions that perform network operations (such as <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Send%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Receive%2A>) wait until the operation completes before returning control to the calling program. In asynchronous mode, these calls return immediately.
