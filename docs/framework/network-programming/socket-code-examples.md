# Socket Code Examples
The following code examples demonstrate how to use the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class as a client to connect to remote network services and as a server to listen for connections from remote clients.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Synchronous Client Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-client-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement a synchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> client that connects to a server and displays the data returned from the server.  
  
 [Synchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-server-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement a synchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> server that accepts connections from a client and echoes back the data received from the client.  
  
 [Asynchronous Client Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/asynchronous-client-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement an asynchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> client that connects to a server and displays the data returned from the server.  
  
 [Asynchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/asynchronous-server-socket-example.md)  
 Shows how to implement an asynchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> server that accepts connections from a client and echoes back the data received from the client.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/sockets.md)  
 Provides basic information about the <xref:System.Net.Sockets> namespace and the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class.  
  
 [Security in Network Programming](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/security-in-network-programming.md)  
 Describes how to use standard Internet security and authentication techniques.
