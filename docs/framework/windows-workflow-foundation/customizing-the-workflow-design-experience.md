# Customizing the Workflow Design Experience
The scenarios for designing custom activities and for rehosting the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] have been greatly simplified in [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)]. Development and deployment are now both easier and more flexible. The key infrastructural change is that the new activity designer programming model is built upon [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)]. This gives you the ability to define activity designers declaratively and to rehost the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)] in other applications with comparative easy. When rehosting, a custom expression editor can be developed to support IntelliSense or a simplified expression domain. The integration with [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] has become more seamless with use of workflow services. Custom activity designers and the Model Item Tree can be used to enhance design time experiences in rehosted workflow designers.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using Custom Activity Designers and Templates](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-custom-activity-designers-and-templates.md)  
 Describes how to create new custom activity designers and templates.  
  
 [Rehosting the Workflow Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/rehosting-the-workflow-designer.md)  
 Describes how to re-host the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and how to display validation errors.  
  
 [Using a Custom Expression Editor](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-a-custom-expression-editor.md)  
 Describes how to implement a custom expression editor to use with workflow designers rehosted outside of [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].
