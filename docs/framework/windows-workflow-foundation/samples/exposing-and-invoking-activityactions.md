# Exposing and Invoking ActivityActions
This sample demonstrates how to develop a custom activity that has an <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction>. It also demonstrates how to use this activity by providing an implementation of the <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction>.  
  
 An <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction> allows an activity author to expose "holes" with specific signatures where the activity user can plug in a custom behavior. For example, the <!--zz <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach>--> `System.Activities.Statements.ForEach` activity, (which operates over a collection of items), has an <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction> that allows the activity user to plug in behavior that operates on the current iteration item.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Open the **ActivityAction.sln** sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Build and run the solution.
