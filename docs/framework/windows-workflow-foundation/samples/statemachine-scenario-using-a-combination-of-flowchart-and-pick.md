# StateMachine Scenario Using a Combination of FlowChart and Pick
This sample demonstrates how to implement a simple stopwatch scenario using a combination of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activities. It uses Receive and Send within the Pick activity to listen for stopwatch events.

## Sample Details  
 The following table lists the projects in this sample.  
  
|Project Name|Description|  
|-|-|  
|StopWatchService|This project contains the implementation of a state machine for the stopwatch sample using a combination of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activities.<br /><br /> The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activity has 3 <xref:System.Activities.Statements.PickBranch> statements within the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick.Branches%2A> property that listen for `GetStart`, `GetStop` and `GetOff` events. Based on the incoming event, the triggers for one of the branches activate and the corresponding <xref:System.Activities.Statements.PickBranch.Action%2A> is triggered. In the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.PickBranch.Action%2A> property, there is a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601> statement that evaluates whether the transition is a legitimate transition and if it is, the `currentState` property is updated to the transitioning state and sent to the client.<br /><br /> The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowDecision> activity at the end of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> evaluates the `currentState` property to determine whether the state is terminal. If it is, the workflow ends; otherwise control loops back to the start of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activity where the workflow waits for more stopwatch events.|  
|StopWatchClient|This is a simple sequential workflow console application that sends various stopwatch events with simple Send or Receive activity combinations.|  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open StateMachineWithPick.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  Start the StopWatchService.exe from [!INCLUDE[fileExplorer](../../../../includes/fileexplorer-md.md)] as an administrator by right clicking the .exe file and selecting **Run as administrator**.  
  
    1.  Navigate to the StateMachineWithPick\CS\StopWatchService\bin\Debug folder.  
  
    2.  Right-click the StopWatchService.exe file and select **Run as administrator**.  
  
4.  Start the StopWatchClient client application from within [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
    1.  In **Solution Explorer**, select the **StopWatchClient** project and right-click **Set as StartUp Project**.  
  
    2.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  
  
5.  Switch back to the console window for the StopWatchService.exe to view the state transitions.
