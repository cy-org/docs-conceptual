# Programming Model Item Tree
This sample demonstrates how to navigate the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> tree using declarative data binding from the [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] Tree View.  
  
## Sample Details  
 The <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> tree is the abstraction that is used by the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] infrastructure to expose the data about the underlying instance being edited. The following illustration is a depiction of the various layers of infrastructure within the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)].  
  
 ![Workflow Designer Architecture](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/media/workflowdesignerarch.JPG "WorkflowDesignerArch")  
  
 A <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> consists of a pointer to the underlying value, as well as a collection of <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelProperty> objects. A <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelProperty> object in turn, consists of data such as the name and type of the property and then a pointer to the value, which in turn, is another <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem>. A value converter is used to manipulate some of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem>s returned from a <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelProperty> to make them appear correctly in the tree view. The sample then demonstrates how to imperatively program against the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> tree using the imperative syntax, as seen in the following example.  
  
```csharp  
ModelItem mi = wd.Context.Services.GetService<ModelService>().Root;  
ModelProperty mp = mi.Properties["Activities"];  
mp.Collection.Add(new Persist());  
ModelItem justAdded = mp.Collection.Last();  
justAdded.Properties["DisplayName"].SetValue("new name");  
```  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Open the ProgrammingModelItemTree.sln solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Build the solution by selecting **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu.  
  
3.  Press F5 to run the application. The [!INCLUDE[avalon2](../../../../includes/avalon2-md.md)] form is then displayed.  
  
4.  Click the **Load WF** button to load the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> and bind it to the tree view.  
  
5.  Clicking the **Change Model Item Tree** button executes the preceding code to add an item into the tree and set a property.
