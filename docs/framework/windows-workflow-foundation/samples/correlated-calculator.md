# Correlated Calculator
This sample demonstrates how to use the messaging activities (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>) in the designer with content-based correlation based on a parameter in the message. In this scenario, the operations of the calculator are in a parallel convoy. Both an instance and a correlation (based on `CalculatorId`) are created when the first message is sent to the workflow, and subsequent messages with the same `CalculatorId` are dispatched to that instance until the Reset operation is called. The client is implemented as a WPF application that uses a code-based client proxy to communicate with the service.  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Start [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] in elevated permissions, open the For.sln solution file.  
  
    1.  Navigate to the folder that contains [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
    2.  Right-click Devenv.exe and select **Run as administrator**.  
  
2.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the CorrelatedCalculator.sln solution file.  
  
3.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
4.  To run the service project, press CTRL+F5.  
  
5.  Once the service is ready and listening for messages, in Solution Explorer, right-click the Client project and run it.
