# Hello World Custom Activity
This sample demonstrates several key features of [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)], including how to create a simple custom activity. Some of the features demonstrated in this sample are creating a custom activity in C# and using `in` and `out` arguments (<xref:System.Activities.InArgument> and <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument>).

## Creating a Workflow in Code  
 In this sample, two custom activities are created using C# code. Both custom activities inherit directly or indirectly from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601> to return a single value. The advantage of using the generic return value, instead of inheriting from the non-generic <xref:System.Activities.Activity> class, is that some activities (such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign>) are able to access the return value when used as part of a composed activity.  
  
 AppendString  
 This activity inherits from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601>, and uses an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity that concatenates two strings together.  
  
 Prepend String  
 This activity inherits directly from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601>, and creates similar functionality to the `AppendString` activity, which uses logic implemented in code rather than being composed of a pre-existing activity.  
  
 The following files are included in this project.  
  
 AppendString.cs  
 The custom activity that appends strings together. It takes in a string and combines it with a literal text string " says hello world" to form a complete message as output.  
  
 PrependString.cs  
 This activity prefixes a predefined string to an input string.  
  
 Sequence1.xaml  
 A workflow that uses the `AppendString` and `PrependString` custom activities.  
  
 Program.cs  
 A program that runs the workflow.
