# Get WorkflowInstanceId
This sample demonstrates how to use the custom activity, `GetWorkflowInstanceId` to return the workflow instance ID.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 Custom activity development, how to access the workflow instance.  
  
## Discussion  
 Getting the instance ID of a running workflow requires writing code. If you want to write a fully-declarative workflow, then you need an activity that can return the workflow instance ID so that the activity can be referenced in the workflow to provide a fully-declarative workflow authoring experience. Many scenarios require access to the instance ID: a few examples are for logging or auditing purposes or for doing application-level correlation by providing the instance ID back to a client for future association (for example, by using this activity inside a SendReply activity).  
  
 `GetWorkflowInstanceId` is implemented as a <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601> because it must return a value of type <xref:System.Guid>, and it must have access to the <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext> for getting the workflowâ€™s instance ID. Its implementation is fairly basic.  
  
```  
public sealed class GetWorkflowInstanceId : CodeActivity<Guid>  
{  
protected override Guid Execute(CodeActivityContext context)  
        {  
            return context.WorkflowInstanceId;  
        }  
}  
```
