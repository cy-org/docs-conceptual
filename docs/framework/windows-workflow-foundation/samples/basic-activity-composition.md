# Basic Activity Composition
This sample demonstrates how to compose custom activities and system-provided activities to build more custom activities.  
  
 The workflow using the Survey activity schedules the Survey with a list of questions, and then outputs the responses received.  
  
## Sample Details  
 This sample uses three custom activities. `ReadLine` is a simple <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>\<string> that creates a <xref:System.Activities.Bookmark> when scheduled, and then sets the `Return`<xref:System.Activities.OutArgument%601> to the value with which the <xref:System.Activities.Bookmark> is resumed. `Prompt` is an <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601>\<string> that takes an <xref:System.Activities.InArgument%601><string\> named `Text` and returns the users response in the `Result`<xref:System.Activities.OutArgument%601>\<string>. The `Prompt` activity uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activities that ship as part of the .NET Framework, and also incorporates the custom `ReadLine` activity for getting user input. The last custom activity is the `Survey` activity. It is an <xref:System.Activities.Activity><ICollection\<string>>.  This activity takes an <xref:System.Activities.InArgument%601><IEnumerable<string\>> named `Questions` and populates the `Result` out argument with the responses. The `Survey` activity uses <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.AddToCollection%601> from the .NET Framework and employs the `Prompt` activity for asking the survey questions and getting responses.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Open the **BasicActivityComposition.sln** sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Build and run the solution.
