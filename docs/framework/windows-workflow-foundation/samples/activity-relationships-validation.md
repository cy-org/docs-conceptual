# Activity Relationships Validation
This sample consists of three activities, `CreateCity`, `CreateState`, and `CreateCountry`. `CreateCity` must be inside a `CreateState` activity, and `CreateState` must be inside a `CreateCountry` activity. For the purpose of this sample, the validation logic is in code for the `CreateState` activity, and in XAML for the `CreateCity` activity. Both constraints have the same behavior.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] provides the following three helper activities that allow the developer to validate relationships between activities:  
  
 <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetParentChain>  
 Provides the collection of all activities that belong to the parent of the current node  
  
 <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetChildSubtree>  
 Provides the collection of all activities that belong to the sub-tree of the current node, excluding the current node  
  
 <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetWorkflowTree>  
 Provides the collection of all activities in the same tree as the current node  
  
 In the sample, a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> activity is used to walk through the collection returned by <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetParentChain>. For every element in the collection, its type is compared to `CreateCountry` (or `CreateState` if `CreateCity` is being validated), and when a match is found the result flag is set to `true`. Finally, an <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation> is used to generate a validation error if the result flag is set to `false`.  
  
### To use this sample  
  
1.  Open the ContainmentValidation.sln sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Build the solution.  
  
3.  Press CTRL + F5 to launch the program.
