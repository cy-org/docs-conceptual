# Using Variables with a .NET Framework 3.5 Ruleset
This sample demonstrates how to create a workflow that uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to integrate a custom activity written in [!INCLUDE[netfx35_short](../../../../includes/netfx35-short-md.md)] that uses policy and rules. The workflow passes data to the custom activity by binding variables to the dependency properties exposed by the custom activity.  
  
## Sample walkthrough  
  
#### To examine TravelRuleLibrary  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], open the InteropWith35RuleSet.sln solution file.  
  
2.  Open the TravelRuleSet.cs in the workflow designer.  
  
     A custom sequential activity that contains a <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.PolicyActivity> is displayed.  
  
3.  Double-click the DiscountPolicy policy activity to examine the rules.  
  
     The Rules editor pops up to show the rules.  
  
4.  Right click the `DiscountPolicy` and select the **View Code** option to examine the code beside C# code for the activity.  
  
     Observe the dependency property setting for `DiscountLevel`. This is equivalent to arguments in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)]arguments, see [Variables and Arguments](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/variables-and-arguments.md).  
  
## InteropWith35RuleSet  
 This is a sequential workflow project that uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to integrate with the custom Rule set created in the `TravelRuleLibrary` project. Variables are created on the top level <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity is used to integrate with the `TravelRuleSet` activity. The variables that are declared on the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> are used to bind to the dependency properties.  
  
## To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the InteropWith35RuleSet.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
