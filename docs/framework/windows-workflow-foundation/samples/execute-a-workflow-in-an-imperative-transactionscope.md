# Execute a Workflow in an Imperative TransactionScope
This sample shows how to execute a workflow using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> under a <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction> from imperative C# code.  
  
## Sample Details  
 In imperative C# code, the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> is used to encapsulate a set of work that executes under the same transaction. The <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> works by creating an ambient transaction and initializing the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A> property, which can then be accessed by any work being executed on that thread.  
  
 To get equivalent behavior in workflow, the runtime has to do the extra work of initializing <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A> before executing each activity because a workflow does not maintain thread affinity between activities. With this runtime support, the resulting behavior is that when executing a workflow with <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> inside a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope>, all activities are guaranteed to run under the context of the ambient transaction created by the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope>.  
  
 A workflow can have only a single ambient transaction for each workflow instance; nested transactions are not available. Even if the workflow contains a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity, this does not create a new inner transaction. Instead, this reuses the ambient transaction that was created outside the workflow.  
  
 The sample begins a new <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope>, prints the transaction ID and begins a workflow using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>. The workflow prints the transaction ID again, showing that it is the same transaction, then runs a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope>, then completes. The <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A> call on <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> is synchronous so the original thread blocks until the workflow completes. Once the workflow is complete, the transaction is completed and resources disposed.
