# WorkflowHostingEndpoint Resume Bookmark
This sample demonstrates how the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowHostingEndpoint> can be used with <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> to create workflow instances.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowHostingEndpoint>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>  
  
## Discussion  
 This sample uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowHostingEndpoint> to create a workflow instance hosted using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowHostingEndpoint> is an extensibility point for <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> that can be used in the following scenarios:  
  
-   Creating new workflow instances.  
  
-   Resuming bookmarks on a workflow instance hosted in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>.  
  
 The sample endpoint that is included exposes a contract that provides operations to create a workflow and return an instance ID, or to create an instance with a specific ID. The sample console application creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> instance with a basic workflow definition, and adds a `CreationEndpoint` to the host. It then calls the `Create` operation on the endpoint to create a new workflow instance.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Build the solution.  
  
2.  Run the application. The `CreationEndpoint` console shows a message that includes the instance ID when the workflow instance is created. The message "Hello World!" is printed by the workflow on successful resumption of the bookmark.
