# Using the WorkflowInvoker Class
This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> class to invoke an activity as if it were a method.  
  
## Sample Details  
 Using the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> class is the simplest way to execute an activity. It is designed for directly running an activity as if it were a method call. It is a lightweight, high-performing, easy to use API for use in scenarios where an activity’s execution does not require the control infrastructure provided by other hosting variations.  
  
 The sample uses a custom activity that derives from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601><Int32\> named `Add` that adds two <xref:System.Activities.InArgument%601>, `X` and `Y`, and returns a `Result`<xref:System.Activities.OutArgument%601>. (<xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601>\<T> derives from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601><T\>, which has an <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument%601>\<T> named `Result`.) A `Dictionary`\<string, object> is used to pass arguments into an activity being invoked through <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>. The key of the dictionary corresponds to the name of an argument on the invoked activity. The value associated with a particular key is bound to the argument identified by the key.  
  
 The sample calls <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A> and passes a dictionary that contains values for `X` and `Y`. The <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> class binds these values to the `Add` activity’s arguments, executes the activity, and returns the result.  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the Invoker.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press F5.
