 [Advanced Policy](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/advanced-policy.md)

 [Simple Policy](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/simple-policy.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use a <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.PolicyActivity> activity in a workflow.  
  
 [IfElse With Rules](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/ifelse-with-rules.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of a rule condition with an <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.IfElseActivity> activity.  
  
 [Conditioned Activity Group](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/conditioned-activity-group.md)  
 Demonstrates a travel booking application.  
  
 [Order Processing with Policy](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/order-processing-with-policy.md)  
 Demonstrates some of the key features introduced in the [!INCLUDE[netfx35_long](../../../../includes/netfx35-long-md.md)] of the [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].
