# Migration
This section contains samples that demonstrate how to migrate [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] content written using [!INCLUDE[netfx35_short](../../../../includes/netfx35-short-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using a .NET Framework 3.0 or .NET Framework 3.5 Activity in a .NET Framework 4.5 Workflow](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-a-net-3-0-or-net-3-5-activity-in-a-net-4-5-workflow.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to pass a string as an argument to a custom [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)] activity.  
  
 [Using Interop with External Data Exchange](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-interop-with-external-data-exchange.md)  
 Demonstrates how to configure and run a WF3 workflow that uses <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.ExternalDataExchangeService> (and corresponding custom activities for calling methods and handling events) by using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity in a WF4 workflow service.
