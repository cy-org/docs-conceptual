# Code-Bodied
This section contains custom activity samples created declaratively in code.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Bookmarks](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/bookmarks.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to write a custom activity that creates a bookmark to receive external input.  
  
 [Custom Composite using Native Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/custom-composite-using-native-activity.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to write a <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> that schedules other <xref:System.Activities.Activity> objects to control the flow of a workflowâ€™s execution.  
  
 [Execution Properties](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/execution-properties.md)  
 This sample shows how to define and use an execution property in a custom activity.  
  
 [Exposing and Invoking ActivityActions](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/exposing-and-invoking-activityactions.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to develop a custom activity that has an <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction>.  
  
 [Using AsyncCodeActivityContext in an Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-asyncoperationcontext-in-an-activity-sample.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to develop a custom <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity> that uses <xref:System.Activities.AsyncCodeActivityContext> to perform work asynchronously outside of the workflow. 
  
 [Hello World Custom Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/hello-world-custom-activity.md)  
 This sample demonstrates several key features of [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)], including how to create a simple custom activity.  
  
 [Dynamic Arguments](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/dynamic-arguments.md)  
 This sample demonstrates how to implement an activity for which the arguments are defined by the activity consumer rather than the activity author.
