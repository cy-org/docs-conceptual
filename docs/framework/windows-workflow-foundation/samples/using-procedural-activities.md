# Using Procedural Activities
The sample uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activities to implement a guessing game. The guessing game selects a random number and the player has to guess that number. When the player submits an incorrect guess, the workflow provides a hint whether to guess higher or lower. If the player guesses the number in less than 7 attempts, a special congratulations is displayed to the user.  
  
## Custom Activities in this Sample  
  
### ReadLine  
 Reads a line of text from the console. This activity derives from the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> class and creates a bookmark that is resumed by the console application when a line is read.  
  
### PromptInt  
 Prompts the user to type in a number and then reads it from a console window. The activity derives from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601> and uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> and `ReadLine` activities.  
  
##### To use this sample

2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
