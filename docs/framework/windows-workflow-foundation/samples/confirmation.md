# Confirmation
This sample shows four common scenarios surrounding the use of <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> and confirmation. The sample runs four workflows to show confirmation. This sample is available in declarative and imperative versions.  
  
## Confirm a Compensable Activity  
 The first workflow demonstrates how to confirm a compensable activity and consists of a sequence of two <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> instances. After the completion of the second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> a confirm activity confirms the first activity. When the workflow successfully completes, all <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> instances that have not been confirmed or compensated are automatically confirmed using the default order. Without the confirm, the second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> would have been confirmed first.  
  
## Explicit Compensation  
 The second scenario shows the affect on default confirmation when a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> is explicitly compensated. The workflow consists of a sequence of two <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> activities, after the second completes the first is explicitly compensated. As a result when the workflow, completes only the second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> is confirmed.  
  
## Controlling the Order of Confirmation for Nested CompensableActivity Activities  
 The third scenario shows how to control the order of confirmation for nested <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>. The scenario consists of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> as the root of the workflow. The body of the root <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> is a sequence of three <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity.ConfirmationHandler%2A> for the root <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> is a sequence that specifies to confirm the first then the second nested <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>. When the workflow completes it confirms the root <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>, which then confirms the first, second and third nested <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>, in that order. As a result, the default confirmation order is essentially reversed. Because the third <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> was not explicitly confirmed as part of the root <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> by the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity.ConfirmationHandler%2A>, it is confirmed according to the default order. However, because it is the only unconfirmed <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> this just means it is confirmed.  
  
## Scoping of Variables  
 The fourth scenario shows how the lifetime of variables defined for a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> or one of their parents are still in scope when the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity.CompensationHandler%2A>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity.ConfirmationHandler%2A> or <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity.CancellationHandler%2A> handlers are executed even if the activity has completed or the workflow has completed. The workflow consists of a sequence of two <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>. In the body of the first, the variable `mySum` is set to the sum of 5 and 10 and the result printed. In the body of the second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>, the sum is set to the sum of the existing sum and 7 and the result printed. A custom confirmation handler is defined for the first <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>, which prints the sum, subtracts 7 and prints the sum again. It is clear by inspecting the printed sums that the variable is in scope not only for the bodies of both <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> but the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity.ConfirmationHandler%2A> as well.  
  
#### To run the sample  
  
1.  Load the solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Run the ConfirmationSample.exe application.  
  
3.  Observe the following output:
