# Content-Based Correlation
This sample demonstrates how the messaging activities (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply>) can be used with multiple content-based correlations.and content-based correlation. In this scenario, a correlation is first initialized based on a purchase order ID, and then another correlation is created later based on the customer ID. This shows how a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity can both follow an existing correlation and initialize a new correlation based on the same incoming message.

 Messaging activities and content-based correlation  
  
## Discussion  
 This sample shows how to use multiple content-based correlations.  In this scenario, a correlation is first initialized based on a purchase order ID, and then another correlation is created later based on the customer ID.  The correlations are cascaded using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity that both follows an existing correlation (PurchaseOrderId) and initializes a new correlation (CustomerId) based on the same incoming message.  To accomplish this, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.CorrelatesOn%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.CorrelatesWith%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive.CorrelationInitializers%2A> properties.  
  
## To use this sample  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] with elevated permissions, by right-clicking the [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] icon and selecting **Run as administrator**.  
  
2.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the CascadingCorrelation.sln solution file.  
  
3.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
4.  To run the server, press F5.  
  
5.  Once the service is ready and listening for messages, in Solution Explorer, right-click the Client project and run it.
