# External Activity Validation
This sample shows how to add validation logic to a built-in activity that you are not the author of. The validation logic consists of enforcing that all <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activities present in the workflow either have their <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Then%2A> property set or their <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If.Else%2A> property set. Also, the validation logic includes checking that all <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activities present in the workflow have more than one branch, and if that is not the case, a warning is generated.  
  
## Sample details  
 This sample creates a workflow with an instance of each activity to validate: the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activity and the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activity. A <xref:System.Activities.Validation.Constraint> is created for each validation behavior. The constraints created in this sample are `ConstraintError_IfShouldHaveThenOrElse` and `ConstraintWarning_PickHasOneBranch`. Next, these constraints are added to the `AdditionalConstraints` collection of a <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings> instance. Finally, the `static`<xref:System.Activities.Validation.ActivityValidationServices.Validate%2A> method of <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ActivityValidationServices> is called to validate the activities in the workflow and the validation results are printed out to the console.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can add policy constraints to any activity. For example, you can add a policy constraint to a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> or <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> activity.  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the ExternalActivityValidation.sln file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press Ctrl+F5.
