# Using the ExpressionTextBox in a Custom Activity Designer
This sample shows how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.ExpressionTextBox> in a custom activity designer. The custom activity, `MultiAssign`, assigns two string values to two string variables. Some <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.ExpressionTextBox> controls bind to <xref:System.Activities.InArgument>s and some bind to <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument>s.  
  
## Sample details  
 The `ArgumentToExpressionConverter` is the type converter used when binding expressions to arguments. The `ConverterParameter` must be set to `In` or `Out` as appropriate. `InOut` is not supported.  
  
 The `UseLocationExpression` attribute is used on `OutArgument`s to specify that the expression should be an L-value ("left value" or "location value") expression. In most cases, an L-value expression is a valid Visual Basic identifier used to indicate that the `OutArgument` being returned is a variable or argument name.  
  
 The `MaxLines` attribute is set to one in this example and `MinLines` is not set. This indicates that the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.ExpressionTextBox> is a fixed size of one line regardless of the amount of text typed by the user. To allow the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.ExpressionTextBox> to grow to fit user input, set `MaxLines` greater than `MinLines`.  
  
 An ExpressionTextBox can only be bound to arguments, and cannot be bound to CLR properties.  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the ExpressionTextBoxSample.sln file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
#### To run this sample  
  
1.  Add a new Workflow Console Application to the solution.  
  
2.  Add a reference to the **ExpressionTextBoxSample** project from the new Workflow Console Application project.  
  
3.  Build the solution.  
  
4.  Drag the **MultiAssign** activity from the toolbox and drop it into the workflow.
