# Fault Handling in a Flowchart Activity Using TryCatch
This sample shows how the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity can be used within a complex control flow activity.  
  
 In this sample, a promotion code and number of children are passed as variables to a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity that calculates a discount based on formulae that correspond to the promotion code. The sample includes imperative code and workflow designer versions of the sample.  
  
 The following table details the variables for the `CreateFlowchartWithFaults` activity.  
  
|Parameters|Description|  
|----------------|-----------------|  
|promoCode|The promotion code. Type: String<br /><br /> The possible values with description in parentheses:<br /><br /> -   Single (Single)<br />-   MNK (Married with no kids.)<br />-   MWK (Married with kids.)|  
|numKids|The number of children. Type: int|  
  
 The `CreateFlowchartWithFaults` activity uses a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.FlowSwitch%601> activity that switches on the `promoCode` argument and calculates the discount using the following formula.  
  
|Value of `promoCode`|Discount (%)|  
|--------------------------|--------------------|  
|Single|10|  
|MNK|15|  
|MWK|15 + (1 â€“ 1/`numberOfKids`)\*10 **Note:**  Potentially, this calculation can throw a <xref:System.DivideByZeroException>. So, the discount calculation is wrapped in a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity that catches the <xref:System.DivideByZeroException> exception and sets the discount to zero.|  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the FlowchartWithFaultHandling.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press F5.
