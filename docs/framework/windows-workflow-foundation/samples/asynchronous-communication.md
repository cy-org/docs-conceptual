# Asynchronous Communication
This sample demonstrates how the communication between two different [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] services is done asynchronously by default.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 Asynchronous communication between [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] services.  
  
## Discussion  
 This sample shows how the communication between [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] applications is done asynchronously by using the messaging activities provided by .NET Framework.  
  
 This sample consists of the following three projects.  
  
 CreditCheckService  
 This service receives the credit score of a particular person or the value of the item to acquire, and then decides whether the credit is given to the person.  
  
 RentalApprovalService  
 This service receives an application from a person who is in need of some credit. This service communicates asynchronously with the `CreditCheckService` to decide whether the credit application is valid.  
  
 Client  
 The client communicates synchronously with the `RentalApprovalService` to know whether the credit is approved.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Right-click the **AsynchronousCommunication** solution and select **Properties**.  
  
2.  In **Common Properties**, select **Startup Project**, and select **Multiple Startup Projects**.  
  
3.  Move **RentalApprovalService** to the first position in the list, followed by **CreditCheckService**, followed by **Client**. Set the **Start** action on all three projects.  
  
4.  Click **OK**, and press F5 to run the sample.
