# NoPersistScope Activity
This sample shows how to manipulate a non-serializable and disposable state within a workflow. It is important that workflows do not attempt to persist non-serializable state and it is also important for disposable objects to be cleaned up after they are used in workflow.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 `NoPersistScope` custom activity and designer.  
  
## Using the NoPersistZone activity  
 When the sample workflow runs, a custom activity called `CreateTextWriter` creates an object of type <xref:System.IO.TextWriter> and saves it into a workflow variable. <xref:System.IO.TextWriter> is an <xref:System.IDisposable> object. This <xref:System.IO.TextWriter>, which is configured to write to a file named ‘out.txt’ in the directory in which the sample runs, is used by a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity as it echoes any text you type in at the console.  
  
 The echo logic runs within a `NoPersistScope` activity (the code for which is also part of this sample), which prevents the workflow from being persisted. If you type in `unload` at the console, the host attempts to persist the workflow instance but this operation times out because the workflow remains within a `NoPersistScope`. The workflow also utilizes a custom activity called `Dispose` to dispose the <xref:System.IO.TextWriter> object when the workflow is finished using it. The `Dispose` activity is placed within the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch.Finally%2A> block of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity in which the <xref:System.IO.TextWriter> variable is declared, to ensure that it runs even if an exception should occur during execution of the Try block.  
  
 You can type in `exit` to complete the workflow instance and exit the program.  
  
#### To run the sample  
  
1.  Open the NoPersistZone.sln solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B or select **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu.  
  
3.  Once the build has succeeded, press F5 or select **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu alternatively, you can press CTRL+F5 or select **Start Without Debugging** from the **Debug** menu to run without debugging.  
  
#### To cleanup (optional)  
  
1.  To remove the SQL Instance Store, run Cleanup.cmd.
