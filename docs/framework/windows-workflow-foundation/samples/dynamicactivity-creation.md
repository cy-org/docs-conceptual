# DynamicActivity Creation
This sample demonstrates two different ways to create an activity at runtime using the <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity> activity.  
  
 In this sample, an activity is created at runtime with a body that contains a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity that contains <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign%601> activities. An input list of integers is passed into the activity and set as a property. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> activity then iterates over the list of values and accumulates it. In the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign%601> activity, the average value is calculated by dividing the accumulator by the number of elements in the list and assign it to the average.  
  
 The sample demonstrates the usage of a <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity> activity that flows in variables as input arguments and returning values as output arguments. The activity has one input argument named `Numbers` that is a list of integers. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> activity iterates over the list of values and accumulates it. In the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign%601> activity, the average value is calculated by dividing the accumulator by the number of elements in the list and assigning it to the average. The average is returned as an output argument named `Average`.  
  
 When the dynamic activity is created programmatically, the input and output are declared as shown in the following code example.  
  
```csharp  
DynamicActivity act = new DynamicActivity()  
{  
    DisplayName = "Find average",  
    Properties =   
    {  
        // Input argument  
        new DynamicActivityProperty  
        {  
            Name = "Numbers",  
            Type = typeof(InArgument<List<int>>),  
            Value = numbers  
        },  
        // Output argument  
        new DynamicActivityProperty  
        {  
            Name = "Average",  
            Type = typeof(OutArgument<double>),  
            Value = average  
        }  
    },  
};  
```  
  
 The following code example shows the complete definition of the `DynamicActivity` that computes the average of the values in a list.  
  
```  
DynamicActivity act = new DynamicActivity()  
{  
    DisplayName = "Find average",  
    Properties =   
    {  
        // Input argument  
        new DynamicActivityProperty  
        {  
            Name = "Numbers",  
            Type = typeof(InArgument<List<int>>),  
            Value = numbers  
        },  
        // Output argument  
        new DynamicActivityProperty  
        {  
            Name = "Average",  
            Type = typeof(OutArgument<double>),  
            Value = average  
        }  
    },  
    Implementation = () =>  
        new Sequence  
        {  
            Variables = { result, accumulator },  
            Activities =  
            {  
                new ForEach<int>  
                {  
                    Values =  new ArgumentValue<IEnumerable<int>> { ArgumentName = "Numbers" },                                  
                    Body = new ActivityAction<int>  
                    {  
                        Argument = iterationVariable,  
                        Handler = new Assign<int>  
                        {  
                            To = accumulator,  
                            Value = new InArgument<int>(env => iterationVariable.Get(env) +  accumulator.Get(env))  
                        }  
                    }  
                },  
  
                // Calculate the average and assign to the output argument.  
                new Assign<double>  
                {  
                    To = new ArgumentReference<double> { ArgumentName = "Average" },  
                    Value = new InArgument<double>(env => accumulator.Get(env) / numbers.Get(env).Count<int>())  
                },  
            }  
        }  
};  
```  
  
 When created in XAML, the input and output are declared as shown in the following example.  
  
```xml  
<Activity x:Class="Microsoft.Samples.DynamicActivityCreation.FindAverage"  
          xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/netfx/2009/xaml/activities"  
          xmlns:scg="clr-namespace:System.Collections.Generic;assembly=mscorlib"  
          xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">  
  <x:Members>  
    <x:Property Name="Numbers" Type="InArgument(scg:List(x:Int32))" />  
    <x:Property Name="Average" Type="OutArgument(x:Double)" />  
  </x:Members>  
    ...  
    ...  
</Activity>  
```  
  
 The XAML can be created visually using the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)]. If it is included in a Visual Studio project, be sure to set its "Build Action" to "None" to prevent it from being compiled. The XAML can then be loaded dynamically using the following call.  
  
```  
Activity act2 = ActivityXamlServices.Load(@"FindAverage.xaml");  
```  
  
 The <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity> instance created programmatically or through loading a XAML workflow can be used as shown in the following code example. Please note that "act" passed to the `WorkflowInvoker.Invoke` is the "act" <xref:System.Activities.Activity> defined in the first code example.  
  
```  
IDictionary<string, object> results = WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(act, new Dictionary<string, object> { { "Numbers", numbers } });  
  
Console.WriteLine("The average calculated using the code activity is = " + results["Average"]);  
```  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the DynamicActivityCreation.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  
  
## Command line arguments  
 This sample accepts command line arguments. Users can provide a list of numbers for the activity to calculate their average. The list of numbers to be used is passed as a list of numbers separated by a space. For example, to calculate the average of 5, 10, and 32 invoke the sample using the following command line.  
  
 **DynamicActivityCreation 5 10 32**
