# LINQ to Objects Activity
This sample demonstrates how to create an activity to use LINQ to Objects to query elements in a collection.  
  
## Activity Details for FindInCollection  
 This activity allows users to query elements from collections in memory using LINQ to Objects. You must provide a LINQ predicate in the form of a lambda expression to filter the results. This activity can be used in conjunction with <xref:System.Activities.Statements.AddToCollection%601> activities.  
  
 The following table details the property and return values for the activity.  
  
|Property or Return Value|Description|  
|------------------------------|-----------------|  
|`Collection` property|A required property that specifies the source collection.|  
|`Predicate` property|A required property that specifies the filter for the collection in the form of a lambda expression.|  
|Return Value|The filtered collection.|  
  
## Code Sample that uses the Custom Activity  
 The following code example uses the `FindInCollection` custom activity to find all rows in a collection of employees that have a `Role` property set to `Manager` and the `Location` property set to `Redmond`.  
  
```csharp  
// Find all program managers in Redmond in the employees collection.  
  
Activity wf = new FindInCollection<Employee>  
{  
    Collections = new LambdaValue<IEnumerable<Employee>>(c => employees),                
    Predicate = new LambdaValue<Func<Employee, bool>>(c => new Func<Employee, bool>(e => e.Role.Equals("Manager") && e.Location.Equals("Redmond")))  
};  
```  
  
 The following code shows how to create a workflow program that uses the custom FindInCollection activity, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.AddToCollection%601>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> activities to populate a collection with employees, find all the employees that have developer roles and are located in Redmond, and then iterate through the resulting list.  
  
```csharp  
// Create the Linq predicate for the find expression  
  
Func<Employee, bool> predicate = e => e.Role == "DEV" && e.Location.Equals("Redmond");  
  
// Create workflow program  
Activity sampleWorkflow = new Sequence  
{  
    Variables = { employees, devsFromRedmond },  
    Activities =  
    {  
        new Assign<IList<Employee>>  
        {  
            To = employees,  
            Value = new LambdaValue<IList<Employee>>(c => new List<Employee>())  
        },  
        new AddToCollection<Employee>  
        {  
            Collection = new InArgument<ICollection<Employee>>(employees),  
            Item =  new LambdaValue<Employee>(c => new Employee(1, "Employee 1", "DEV", "Redmond"))  
        },  
        new AddToCollection<Employee>  
        {  
            Collection = new InArgument<ICollection<Employee>>(employees),  
            Item =  new LambdaValue<Employee>(c => new Employee(2, "Employee 2", "DEV", "Redmond"))  
        },  
        new AddToCollection<Employee>  
        {  
            Collection = new InArgument<ICollection<Employee>>(employees),  
            Item =  new LambdaValue<Employee>(c => new Employee(3, "Employee 3", "PM", "Redmond"))  
        },  
        new AddToCollection<Employee>  
        {  
            Collection = new InArgument<ICollection<Employee>>(employees),  
            Item =  new LambdaValue<Employee>(c => new Employee(4, "Employee 4", "PM", "China"))  
        },  
        new FindInCollection<Employee>  
        {  
            Collections = new InArgument<IEnumerable<Employee>>(employees),  
            Predicate = new LambdaValue<Func<Employee, bool>>(c => predicate),  
            Result = new OutArgument<IList<Employee>>(devsFromRedmond)  
        },  
        new ForEach<Employee>  
        {  
            Values = new InArgument<IEnumerable<Employee>>(devsFromRedmond),  
            Body = new ActivityAction<Employee>  
            {  
                Argument = iterationVariable,  
                Handler = new WriteLine  
                {  
                    Text = new InArgument<string>(env => iterationVariable.Get(env).ToString())  
                }  
            }  
        }  
    }  
};  
```
