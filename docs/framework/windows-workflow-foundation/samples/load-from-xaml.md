# Load From XAML
This sample demonstrates how to dynamically load a XAML workflow without having to run the XamlBuildTask tool. Instead, the sample calls the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A> method. The sample is a [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] client application that loads XAML workflows using the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices> class and executes them. After they have been loaded using the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices> class, a <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity%601> is returned that can be executed.  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the LoadFromXAML.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
