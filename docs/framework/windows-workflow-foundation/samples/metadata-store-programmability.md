# Metadata Store Programmability
The metadata store is a [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] feature that allows for the association of arbitrary metadata, in the form of CLR attributes, to types at runtime. This allows for a loose coupling between the run-time components and their design-time counterparts, as well as the ability to change the design-time components without affecting the runtime. The sample shows how to program against the metadata store by applying attributes to a run-time type, the source for which we have no control over. The terminology typically used is that a hosting application registers the metadata for a set of types.  
  
 Within the output, you may notice an additional, unexpected attribute, <!--zz <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.GUIDAttribute> --> `System.Runtime.InteropServices.GUIDAttribute`. This is added when using the Metadata API and has no impact on the running of the sample.  
  
 This sample demonstrates:  
  
## Demonstrates  
  
-   Attribute injection using the metadata store API.  
  
-   Using a callback mechanism to defer metadata registration.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the ProgrammingMetadataStore.sln solution file.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press F5.
