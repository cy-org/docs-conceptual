# SQLStoreExtensibility
This sample demonstrates the use and configuration of promoted properties in the SQL workflow instance store. The SQL workflow instance store is a SQL-based implementation of an instance store. It allows an instance to save its state and load its state to and from a SQL Server or SQL Server Express database. The store extensibility feature allows the user to define properties that are stored in the instance store. These properties are displayed in a promoted properties view that allows the user to query for them.  
  
 This sample consists of a workflow that implements a counting service. Once the service's start method is invoked, the service counts from 0 to 29. The counter is incremented once every 2 seconds. After each count, the workflow persists. The current counter value is stored in the instance store as a promoted property.  
  
 The Counting Workflow is self-hosted by a Workflow Service Host. The program's `Main` method performs the following actions:  
  
-   Creates an instance of the Workflow Service Host that hosts the Counting Workflow and defines the endpoints under which the Counting Workflow can be reached.  
  
-   Defines a SQL workflow instance store behavior, which is used to configure the SQL workflow instance store. The store is instructed to treat `CountStatus` as a promoted property.  
  
-   Creates a client that calls the start method of the counting workflow.  
  
 Once the program is started, the counter automatically starts counting. Note that it might take a few seconds to load the instance and configure the SQL workflow instance store.  
  
 To promote the counter value as a custom property, the following steps must be taken:  
  
1.  The class `CounterStatus` defines an instance extension of type <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant>, which is used by activities to supply the state variables. `Count` is defined as a write-only value. When a workflow instance comes to a persistence point, the instance extension saves the `Count` property into the persistence data collection.  
  
2.  When creating the instance store, a new property, `CountStatus`, is defined through the `store.Promote()` method.  
  
3.  The workflow's `SaveCounter` activity assigns the current counter value to the `Count` status field.  
  
### To use this sample  
  
1.  Create the instance store database.  
  
    1.  Open a [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] command prompt.  
  
    2.  Navigate to the sample directory (\WF\Basic\Persistence\SqlStoreExtensibility\CS) and run CreateInstanceStore.cmd in the [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] command prompt.  
  
        > [!WARNING]
        >  The CreateInstanceStore.cmd script attempts to create the database on the default instance of SQL Server 2008 Express. If you want to install the database on a different instance, modify the script to do so.  
  
2.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] and load the SqlStoreExtensibility.sln solution and build it by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
    > [!WARNING]
    >  If you installed the database on a non-default instance of SQL Server, update the connection string in the code prior to building the solution.  
  
3.  Run the sample with administrator privileges by navigating to the projectâ€™s bin directory (\WF\Basic\Persistence\SqlStoreExtensibility\bin\Debug) in [!INCLUDE[fileExplorer](../../../../includes/fileexplorer-md.md)], right-clicking SqlStoreExtensibility.exe and selecting **Run as Administrator**.  
  
### To verify the sample is working correctly  
  
1.  Use SQL Server Management Studio to view the contents of the instance table by selecting **Databases**, **InstanceStore**, and then **System.ServiceModel.Activities.DurableInstancing.InstanceTable** in the Object Explorer, right-click **System.ServiceModel.Activities.DurableInstancing.InstanceTable** and select **Select Top 1000 Rows**. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] SQL Server Management Studio, see [Introducing SQL Server Management Studio](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=165645)  
  
2.  Observe the workflow instances listed.  
  
3.  In a [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] command prompt, run the QueryInstanceStore.cmd script located in the sample directory (\WF\Basic\Persistence\SqlStoreExtensibility).  
  
4.  Observe the counter value displayed under **CountStatus**.  
  
5.  Run the script a few times to see the **CountStats** value change.  
  
6.  Press ENTER to terminate the workflow application.  
  
### To uninstall the sample  
  
1.  Remove the instance store database by running the RemoveInstanceStore.cmd script located in the sample directory (\WF\Basic\Persistence\SqlStoreExtensibility).
