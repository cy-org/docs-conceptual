# Compensation (Samples)
This section contains samples related to compensation in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Compensable Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/compensable-activity-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> activity to define the work to be done for a given action during normal execution and the work that is necessary to be done to compensate that action, if necessary at a later time.  
  
 [Custom Compensation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/custom-compensation-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> and its compensation handler to define custom compensation logic.  
  
 [Confirmation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/confirmation.md)  
 Demonstrates four common scenarios surrounding the use of <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity> and confirmation.  
  
 [Cancellation Handler on Compensable Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/cancellation-handler-on-compensable-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of a cancellation handler on a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>.
