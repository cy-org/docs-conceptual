# InvokeMethod
This sample shows the different ways of using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity to invoke methods of a class.  
  
 A method belongs to a class and represents a contained set of operations. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity gives you the ability to call methods against objects or types, pass in parameters, and get the return value. Methods can be invoked synchronously or asynchronously.  
  
## Sample Details  
 This sample uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity to perform the following scenarios:  
  
1.  Invoke an instance method without parameters.  
  
2.  Invoke an instance method with two parameters (<xref:System.String> and <xref:System.Int32>).  
  
3.  Invoke an instance method with two parameters (<xref:System.String> and <xref:System.Int32>) and a parameter array of type <xref:System.String>[].  
  
4.  Invoke an instance method with two parameters of type <xref:System.Int32> and a result of type <xref:System.Int32>. In this scenario, the result value is bound to a variable and used in another activity. It is displayed in the console using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity.  
  
5.  Invoke a static method with two parameters of type <xref:System.String> and <xref:System.Int32>.  
  
6.  Invoke an instance method with one generic parameter of type <xref:System.String>.  
  
7.  Invoke a static method with two generic parameters of type <xref:System.String> and <xref:System.Int32>.  
  
8.  Invoke an instance method that has one parameter passed by reference of type <xref:System.String>. In this scenario, the reference parameter is bound to a variable (`outParam`) and used in another activity. It is displayed on the console using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity.  
  
9. Invoke an asynchronous instance method.  
  
10. Invoke two different methods on the same instance of an object using two <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activities.  
  
11. Store a value in an instance of an object.  
  
12. Retrieve a value from an instance of an object.  
  
## To use this sample  
 This sample is provided in two versions. The first version of this sample demonstrates the usage of <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> through C# code using the [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] programming model and can be found under the CodedWorkflow\CS folder. The second version demonstrates the usage of <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> using XAML and can be found under the DesignerWorkflow\CS folder.  
  
#### To run the coded workflow sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the InvokeMethodUsage.sln solution file in the CodedWorkflow\CS folder.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  
  
#### To run the designer workflow sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the InvokeMethodUsage.sln solution file in the DesignerWorkflow\CS folder.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
