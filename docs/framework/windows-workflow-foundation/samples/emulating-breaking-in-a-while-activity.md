# Emulating breaking in a While activity
This sample demonstrates how to break the looping mechanism of the following activities: <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601>.  
  
 This is useful because [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] does not include any activity to break the execution of these loops.  
  
## Scenario  
 The sample finds the first reliable vendor from a list of vendors (instances of the `Vendor` class). Each vendor has an `ID`, a `Name` and a numeric reliability value that determines how dependable the vendor is. The sample creates a custom activity called `FindReliableVendor` that receives two input parameters (a list of vendors and a minimum reliability value) and returns the first vendor of the list that matches the supplied criteria.  
  
## Breaking a Loop  
 [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] does not include an activity to break a loop. The code sample accomplishes breaking a loop by using an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activity and several variables. In the sample, the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While> activity is broken once the `reliableVendor` variable is assigned a value other than `null`.  
  
 The following code example demonstrates how the sample breaks a while loop.  
  
```csharp  
// Iterates while the "i" variable is lower than the size of the list   
// and any reliable Vendor is found.        
new While(env => i.Get(env) < this.Vendors.Get(env).Count && reliableVendor.Get(env) == null)  
{  
    DisplayName = "Main loop. Breaks when a reliable vendor is found",  
    Body = new Sequence  
    {                              
        Activities =  
        {  
            // This is the if used for setting the value of the break value…  
            new If  
            {  
                DisplayName = "Check for a reliable vendor",  
  
                //  If a vendor satisfies the reliability level…  
                Condition = new InArgument<bool>(env =>   
                           this.Vendors.Get(env)[i.Get(env)].Reliability >   
                           this.MinimumReliability.Get(env)),  
  
                // then assign that vendor to the reliable vendor variable and   
                // the while condition becomes false (exit the loop).  
                Then = new Assign<Vendor>  
                {  
                    To = reliableVendor,  
                    Value = new InArgument<Vendor>(env =>   
                                  this.Vendors.Get(env)[i.Get(env)])  
                }  
            },  
  
            // Increment the iteration variable.   
            new Assign<int>  
            {  
                DisplayName = "Increment iteration variable",  
                To = i,  
                Value = new InArgument<int>(env => i.Get(env) + 1)  
            }   
        }  
    }  
}  
```
