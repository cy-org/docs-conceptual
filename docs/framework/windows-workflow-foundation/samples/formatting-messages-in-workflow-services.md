# Formatting messages in Workflow Services
This sample shows how different user types can be used in messaging activities (WF services). The sample service is a simple expense approval service and exposes three operations. `ApproveExpense` takes a data contract type and shows how to use known types. The operation returns `true` or `false` based on the expense amount. `ApprovePO` takes an XmlSerializer type and returns `true` or `false` based on the expense amount.`ApprovedVendor` takes a message contract type and returns `true` or `false` if the vendor is in the list of approved vendors or if the request came from the finance department (the finance department can use any vendor).  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Load the project solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] and build the project.  
  
2.  First run the service, generated in [solution base directory]\FormatterService\bin\debug\  
  
3.  Second, run the Client application generated in [solution base directory]\FormatterClient\bin\debug.  
  
4.  The client calls three operations on the service and prints the results. When complete, press ENTER to exit the client and then the service.
