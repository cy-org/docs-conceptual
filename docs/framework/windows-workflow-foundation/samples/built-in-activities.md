# Built-in Activities
This section contains samples that demonstrate built-in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] activities.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Fault Handling in a Flowchart Activity Using TryCatch](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/fault-handling-in-a-flowchart-activity-using-trycatch.md)  
 Demonstrates how the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity can be used within a complex control flow activity.  
  
 [Emulating breaking in a While activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/emulating-breaking-in-a-while-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to break the looping mechanism of the following activities: <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601>.  
  
 [DynamicActivity Creation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/dynamicactivity-creation.md)  
 Demonstrates two different ways to create an activity at runtime using the <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity> activity.  
  
 [Using Variables with a .NET Framework 3.5 Ruleset](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-variables-with-dotnet-ruleset.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a workflow that uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to integrate a custom activity written in [!INCLUDE[netfx35_short](../../../../includes/netfx35-short-md.md)] that uses policy and rules.  
  
 [Load From XAML](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/load-from-xaml.md)  
 Demonstrates how to dynamically load a XAML workflow without having to run the XamlBuildTask tool.  
  
 [Using Collection Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-collection-activities.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the collection activities (<xref:System.Activities.Statements.AddToCollection%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ClearCollection%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ExistsInCollection%601>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.RemoveFromCollection%601>) with a class that implements the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> interface and how to create a custom activity that iterates over a collection to print out the contents of each element in the collection.  
  
 [Using the InvokeMethod Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-the-invokemethod-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity to invoke public methods in public classes.  
  
 [Using the Pick Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-the-pick-activity.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick> activity.  
  
 [Using Procedural Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-procedural-activities.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activities to implement a guessing game.  
  
 [Using CancellationScope](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/using-cancellationscope.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope> activity to cancel work in an application.  
  
 [InvokeMethod](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/invokemethod.md)  
 Demonstrates the different ways to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity to invoke methods of a class.  
  
 [Usage of the Switch Activity with Custom Types](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/usage-of-the-switch-activity-with-custom-types.md)  
 Describes how to enable a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601> activity to evaluate a user-defined complex type at runtime.  
  
 [Interop with 3.5 Rule Set](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/interop-with-3-5-rule-set.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to integrate with a custom activity in [!INCLUDE[netfx35_short](../../../../includes/netfx35-short-md.md)] using <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.PolicyActivity> and rules.
