# Creating and Running a Workflow Instance
This sample shows how to run a workflow instance. It shows how to execute it synchronously and asynchronously.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>, <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication>.  
  
## Discussion  
 The first part of the sample uses <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A>. This is the most basic way to execute a workflow. Workflows executed with <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A> are executed synchronously.  
  
 The second part of the sample uses the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> class. <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> enables you to have more control over each instance, including the ability to interact with the running workflow and to run the workflow asynchronously.
