# Using Editing Scope
This sample demonstrates how to batch a set of changes so that they can be undone in a single atomic unit. By default, the actions taken by an activity designer author are automatically integrated into the Undo/Redo system.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 Editing scope and Undo and Redo.  
  
## Discussion  
 This sample demonstrates how to batch a set of changes to the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> tree within a single unit of work. Note that when binding to <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> values directly from a WPF designer, changes are applied automatically. This sample demonstrates what must be done when multiple changes to be batched are being made through imperative code, rather than a single change.  
  
 In this sample, three activities are added. When editing begins, <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem.BeginEdit%2A> is called on an instance of <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem>. Changes made to the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> tree within this editing scope are batched. The <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem.BeginEdit%2A> command returns an <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.EditingScope>, which can be used to control this instance. Either <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.EditingScope.OnComplete%2A> or <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.EditingScope.OnRevert%2A> can be called to either commit or revert the editing scope.  
  
 You can also nest <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.EditingScope> objects, which allows for multiple sets of changes to be tracked as part of a larger editing scope and can be controlled individually. A scenario that may use this feature would be when changes from multiple dialogs must be committed or reverted separately, with all changes being treated as a single atomic operation. In this sample, the editing scopes are stacked using an <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601> of type <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelEditingScope>. The <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601> is used so that the depth of the nesting can be observed on the designer surface.  
  
## To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Build and run the sample, and then use the buttons on the left to modify the workflow.  
  
2.  Click **Open Editing Scope**.  
  
    1.  This command calls <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem.BeginEdit%2A> that creates an editing scope and pushes it onto the editing stack.  
  
    2.  Three activities are then added to the selected <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem>. Note that if the editing scope had not been opened with <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem.BeginEdit%2A>, three new activities would appear on the designer canvas. Because this operation is still pending within the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.EditingScope>, the designer is not yet updated.  
  
3.  Press **Close Editing Scope** to commit the editing scope. Three activities appear in the designer.
