# Basic Validation
This sample consists of an activity, `CreateProduct`, which validates that its `Cost` argument is smaller than or equal to its `Price` argument.  
  
## Sample Details  
 There are two authors that use validation, the activity author (creates the validation logic for the activity) and the workflow author that calls validation services on a specific workflow. In this scenario, the activity author wants to enforce that every instance of his activity must have a smaller or equal cost than that of the price.  
  
 The activity author (inside the activity) must:  
  
-   Create a constraint (`PriceGreaterThanCost`). This is where all the validation logic resides.  
  
-   Override `System.Activities.CodeActivity.OnGetConstraints()` and add the constraint (`PriceGreaterThanCost`) to the constraints <xref:System.Collections.IList>.  
  
 The workflow author (main program) must:  
  
-   Create a workflow with an instance of the activity to validate (`CreateProduct`).  
  
-   Call <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ActivityValidationServices.Validate%2A>, which returns a <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationResults> collection of <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationError>.  
  
-   (Optional) Print the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationError> objects.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Open the BasicValidation.sln sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Build and run the solution.
