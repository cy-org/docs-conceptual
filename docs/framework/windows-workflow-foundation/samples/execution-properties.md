# Execution Properties
This sample shows how to define and use an execution property in a custom activity. In this example, the execution property determines the console's foreground color. An example workflow shows how different logical paths of execution (branches of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> activity) can maintain different console colors despite interleaved execution of activities (across the branches of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> activity).  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Open the ExecutionProperties.sln sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Viewing ThreeColors.xaml before building the solution displays an error, because the custom activities used must be built at the same time as the solution.  
  
2.  Build and run the solution.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.
