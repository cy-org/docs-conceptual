# OperationScope
This sample demonstrates how the messaging activities, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> can be used to expose an existing custom activity as an operation in a workflow service. This sample includes a new custom activity called an `OperationScope`. It is intended to ease the development of a workflow service by allowing users to author the body of their operations separately as custom activities and then easily exposing them as service operations using the `OperationScope` activity. For example, a custom `Add` activity that takes two `in` arguments and returns one `out` argument could be exposed as an `Add` operation on the workflow service by dropping it into an `OperationScope`.  
  
 The scope works by inspecting the activity provided as its body. Any unbound `in` arguments are assumed to be inputs from the incoming message. All `out` arguments, regardless of whether they are bound, are assumed to be outputs in the subsequent reply message. The exposed operationâ€™s name is taken from the display name of the `OperationScope` activity. The end result is that the body activity is wrapped in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> with the parameters from the messages bound to the arguments of the activity.  
  
 This sample exposes a workflow service using HTTP endpoints. To run, proper URL ACLs must be added. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][Configuring HTTP and HTTPS](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70353). Executing the following command at an elevated prompt adds the appropriate ACLs (ensure that your Domain and Username are substituted for %DOMAIN%\\%UserName%).  
  
 **netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8000/ user=%DOMAIN%\\%UserName%**  
  
### To run the sample  
  
1.  Open the OperationScope.sln solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Set multiple start-up projects by right-clicking the solution in Solution Explorer and selecting **Set Startup Projects**. Add Scenario and Scenario_Client (in that order) as multiple start-up projects.  
  
3.  Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution.  
  
    > [!WARNING]
    >  This step is required to view the BankService.xaml workflow due to the custom activity `OperationScope`.  
  
4.  Press CTRL+F5 to run the application. The Scenario_Client console prompts you for inputs and the corresponding output is seen in the Scenario console.
