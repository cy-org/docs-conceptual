# Sending and Handling Faults
This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> messaging activities to send and receive expected and unexpected faults. In this scenario, the first client request results in an expected fault that has been included in its <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send.KnownTypes%2A> collection. The next few client requests result in receiving unexpected faults, before the final request succeeds.

2.  Open the Faults.sln solution file.  
  
3.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
4.  Run the service project.  
  
    1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the `FaultService` project and select **Set as StartUp Project**.
