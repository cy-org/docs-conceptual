# IfElse With Rules
This sample shows the use of a rule condition with an <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.IfElseActivity> activity.  
  
 The sample passes in an `OrderValue` parameter from the host. The value of the parameter is used in a rule condition on the first branch of the <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.IfElseActivity> activity. If the value is less than 10,000, the first branch executes, and the <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.CodeActivity> activity in the first branch prints **Get Manager Approval** to the console. If the value is greater than 10,000, the <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.CodeActivity> activity in the second branch executes and prints **Get VP Approval**.  
  
### To build the sample  
  
1.  Open the solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  
  
2.  Build the solution by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  Run the solution without debugging by pressing CTRL+F5.  
  
### To run the sample  
  
-   In the SDK Command Prompt window, run the .exe file in the IfElseWithRules\bin\debug folder (or the IfElseWithRules\bin folder for the Visual Basic version of the sample), which is located below the main folder for the sample.
