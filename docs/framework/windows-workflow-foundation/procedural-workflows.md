# Procedural Workflows
Procedural workflows use flow-control methods similar to those found in procedural languages. These constructs include `While` and `If`. These workflows can be freely composed using other flow control activities such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>.  
  
## Controlling Execution Flow  
 The workflow activity library has activities for modeling most flow-control methods used in procedural languages. These include:  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>  
  
-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick>  
  
 To use flow control activities, drag and drop them from the **Activity** toolbox into a composite activity inside the designer window.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If using the [!INCLUDE[dublin](../../../includes/dublin-md.md)] to host workflows on a Web farm, AppFabric will move instances between different AppFabric servers. This requires that the resources are able to be shared between all nodes.  None of the default NET 4 workflow activities contain any operations that access local resources. Since AppFabric does not offer any mechanism to mark a workflow as immovable, a developer must not create custom activities that fail when a workflow is moved.
