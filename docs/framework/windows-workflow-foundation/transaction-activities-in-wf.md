# Transaction Activities in WF
The [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] has several system-provided activities for modeling transactions, compensation, and cancellation. These programming models allow the workflow to continue forward progress in the event of changes in business logic and error handling. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)]transactions, compensation, and cancellation, see [Transactions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-transactions.md), [Compensation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/compensation.md), and [Cancellation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/modeling-cancellation-behavior-in-workflows.md).  
  
## Transaction Activities  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope>|Associates cancellation logic, in the form of an activity, with a main path of execution, also expressed as an activity.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>|Supports compensation of its child activities.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.Compensate>|Explicitly invokes the compensation handler of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.Confirm>|Explicitly invokes the confirmation handler of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>.|  
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope>|Demarcates a transaction boundary.|  
|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope>|Scopes the lifetime of a transaction that is initiated by a received message. The transaction may be flowed into the workflow on the initiating message, or created by the dispatcher when the message is received. **Note:**  The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> is located in the **Messaging** section of the **Toolbox**.|
