# Task 2: Host the Workflow Designer
This topic describes the procedure for hosting an instance of the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] in a [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] application.  
  
 The procedure configures the **Grid** control that contains the designer, programmatically creates an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner> that contains a default <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, registers the designer metadata to provide designer support for all built-in activities, and hosts the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)] in the [!INCLUDE[avalon2](../../../includes/avalon2-md.md)] application.  
  
### To host the workflow designer  
  
1.  Open the HostingApplication project you created in [Task 1: Create a New Windows Presentation Foundation Application](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/task-1-create-a-new-wpf-app.md).  
  
2.  Adjust the size of the window to make it easier to use the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)]. To do this, select **MainWindow** in the designer, press F4 to display the **Properties** window, and, in the **Layout** section there, set the **Width** to a value of 600 and the **Height** to a value of 350.  
  
3.  Set the grid name by selecting the **Grid** panel in the designer (click the box inside the **MainWindow**) and setting the **Name** property at the top of the **Properties** window to "grid1".  
  
4.  In the **Properties** window, click the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the `ColumnDefinitions` property to open the **Collection Editor** dialog box.  
  
5.  In the **Collection Editor** dialog box, click the **Add** button three times to insert three columns into the layout. The first column will contain the **Toolbox**, the second column will host the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)], and the third column will be used for the property inspector.  
  
6.  Set the `Width` property of the middle column to the value "4*".  
  
7.  Click **OK** to save the changes. The following XAML is added to your MainWindow.xaml file:  
  
    ```xml  
    <Grid Name="grid1">  
        <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>  
            <ColumnDefinition />  
            <ColumnDefinition Width="4*" />  
            <ColumnDefinition />  
        </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>  
    </Grid>  
    ```  
  
8.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click MainWindow.xaml and select **View Code**. Modify the code by following these steps:  
  
    1.  Add the following namespaces:  
  
        ```csharp  
        using System.Activities;  
        using System.Activities.Core.Presentation;  
        using System.Activities.Presentation;  
        using System.Activities.Presentation.Metadata;  
        using System.Activities.Presentation.Toolbox;  
        using System.Activities.Statements;  
        using System.ComponentModel;  
        ```  
  
    2.  To declare a private member field to hold an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>, add the following code to the `MainWindow` class.  
  
        ```csharp  
        public partial class MainWindow : Window  
        {  
            private WorkflowDesigner wd;  
  
            public MainWindow()  
            {  
                InitializeComponent();  
            }  
        }  
        ```  
  
    3.  Add the following `AddDesigner` method to the `MainWindow` class. The implementation creates an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>, adds a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity to it, and places it in middle column of the grid1 **Grid**.  
  
        ```csharp  
        private void AddDesigner()  
        {  
            //Create an instance of WorkflowDesigner class.  
            this.wd = new WorkflowDesigner();  
  
            //Place the designer canvas in the middle column of the grid.  
            Grid.SetColumn(this.wd.View, 1);  
  
            //Load a new Sequence as default.  
            this.wd.Load(new Sequence());  
  
            //Add the designer canvas to the grid.  
            grid1.Children.Add(this.wd.View);  
        }  
        ```  
  
    4.  Register the designer metadata to add designer support for all the  built-in activities. This enables you to drop activities from the toolbox onto the original <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity in the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)]. To do this, add the `RegisterMetadata` method to the `MainWindow` class.  
  
        ```csharp  
        private void RegisterMetadata()  
        {               
            DesignerMetadata dm = new DesignerMetadata();  
            dm.Register();  
        }  
        ```  
  
         [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] registering activity designers, see [How to: Create a Custom Activity Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-custom-activity-designer.md).  
  
    5.  In the `MainWindow` class constructor, add calls to the methods declared previously to register the metadata for designer support and to create the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>.  
  
        ```csharp  
        public MainWindow()  
        {  
            InitializeComponent();  
  
            // Register the metadata  
            RegisterMetadata();  
  
            // Add the WFF Designer  
            AddDesigner();  
        }  
        ```  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  The `RegisterMetadata` method registers the designer metadata of built-in activities including the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity. Because the `AddDesigner` method uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, the `RegisterMetadata` method must be called first.  
  
9. Press F5 to build and run the solution.  
  
10. See [Task 3: Create the Toolbox and PropertyGrid Panes](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/task-3-create-the-toolbox-and-propertygrid-panes.md) to learn how to add **Toolbox** and **PropertyGrid** support to your rehosted workflow designer.
