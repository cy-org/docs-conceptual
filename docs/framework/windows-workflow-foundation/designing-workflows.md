# Designing Workflows
The topics in this section describe the flow-control paradigms used in workflow development.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Flowchart Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/flowchart-workflows.md)  
 Shows how to create workflows using the familiar flowchart paradigm.  
  
 [Procedural Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/procedural-workflows.md)  
 Shows how to create workflows using a basic, sequential execution paradigm.  
  
 [State Machine Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/state-machine-workflows.md)  
 Discusses how to use Flowchart workflows to implement event-driven workflows in [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)], as a replacement for the State Machine model used in previous versions.  
  
 [Authoring Workflows, Activities, and Expressions Using Imperative Code](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/authoring-workflows-activities-and-expressions-using-imperative-code.md)  
 Describes how to author a workflow with imperative code.
