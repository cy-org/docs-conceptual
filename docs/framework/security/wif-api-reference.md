# WIF API Reference
Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) classes are split across the following assemblies: `mscorlib` (mscorlib.dll), `System.IdentityModel` (System.IdentityModel.dll), `System.IdentityModel.Services` (System.IdentityModel.Services.dll), and `System.ServiceModel` (System.ServiceModel.dll). This topic provides links to the WIF namespaces and brief explanations of the classes that each namespace contains.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The following `System.IdentityModel` namespaces contain classes that implement the WCF claims-based identity model: <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.IdentityModel.Policy?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors?displayProperty=fullName>. Starting with .NET Framework 4.5, the WCF claims-based identity model is superseded by WIF. You should not use classes in these three namespaces when building solutions based on WIF.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that represent cookie transforms, security token services, and specialized XML dictionary readers.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Configuration?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that provide configuration for applications and services built using the Windows Identity Foundation (WIF). The classes in this namespace represent settings under the [\<identityConfiguration>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/identityconfiguration.md) element.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Metadata?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that represent elements in a Federation Metadata document.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Protocols.WSTrust?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that represent WS-Trust artifacts.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Services?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that are used in passive (WS-Federation) scenarios. Also contains some classes that represent settings under the [\<system.identityModel.services>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/system-identitymodel-services.md) element. Settings under this element configure WS-Federation for applications. The `System.IdentityModel.Services.Configuration` namespace contains most of the classes that are used to configure WS-Federation.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Services.Configuration?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that provide configuration for WIF applications that use the WS-Federation protocol. The classes in this namespace represent settings under the [\<system.identityModel.services>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-identity-foundation/system-identitymodel-services.md) element. The `System.IdentityModel.Services` namespace also contains some classes that are used to configure WS-Federation.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Services.Tokens?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains specialized security token handlers for Web farm scenarios.  
  
 <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that represent security tokens, security token handlers, and other security token artifacts.  
  
 <xref:System.Security.Claims?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that represent claims, claims-based identities, claims-based principals, and other claims-based identity model artifacts.  
  
 <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security?displayProperty=fullName>  
 Contains classes that represent WCF contracts, channels, service hosts and other artifacts that are used in active (WS-Trust) scenarios. This namespace also contains classes that are specific to Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and that are not used by WIF.
