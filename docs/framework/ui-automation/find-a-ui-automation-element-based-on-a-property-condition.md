# Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition
> [!NOTE]
>  This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  
  
 This topic contains example code that shows how to locate an element within the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] tree based on a specific property or properties.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, a set of property conditions are specified that identify a certain element (or elements) of interest in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> tree. A search for all matching elements is then performed with the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A> method that incorporates a series of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AndCondition> boolean operations to limit the number of matching elements.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When searching from the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.RootElement%2A>, you should try to obtain only direct children. A search for descendants might iterate through hundreds or even thousands of elements, possibly resulting in a stack overflow. If you are attempting to obtain a specific element at a lower level, you should start your search from the application window or from a container at a lower level.
