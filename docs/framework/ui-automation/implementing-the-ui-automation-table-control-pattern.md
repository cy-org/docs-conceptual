# Implementing the UI Automation Table Control Pattern
> [!NOTE]
>  This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  
  
 This topic introduces guidelines and conventions for implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider>, including information about properties, methods, and events. Links to additional references are listed at the end of the overview.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TablePattern> control pattern is used to support controls that act as containers for a collection of child elements. The children of this element must implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableItemProvider> and be organized in a two-dimensional logical coordinate system that can be traversed by row and column. This control pattern is analogous to <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider>, with the distinction that any control implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider> must also expose a column and/or row header relationship for each child element. For examples of controls that implement this control pattern, see [Control Pattern Mapping for UI Automation Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/control-pattern-mapping-for-ui-automation-clients.md).  
  
<a name="Implementation_Guidelines_and_Conventions"></a>   
## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions  
 When implementing the Table control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:  
  
-   Access to the content of individual cells is through a two-dimensional logical coordinate system or array provided by the required concurrent implementation of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider>.  
  
-   A column or row header can be contained within a table object or be a separate header object that is associated with a table object.  
  
-   Column and row headers may include both a primary header as well as any supporting headers.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This concept becomes evident in a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xl](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xl-md.md)] spreadsheet where a user has defined a "First name" column. This column now has two headersâ€”the "First name" header defined by the user and the alphanumeric designation for that column assigned by the application.  
  
-   See [Implementing the UI Automation Grid Control Pattern](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-grid-control-pattern.md) for related grid functionality.

## Required Members for ITableProvider  
 The following properties and methods are required for the ITableProvider interface.  
  
|Required members|Member type|Notes|  
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider.RowOrColumnMajor%2A>|Property|None|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider.GetColumnHeaders%2A>|Method|None|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider.GetRowHeaders%2A>|Method|None|
