# Implementing the UI Automation Toggle Control Pattern
> [!NOTE]
>  This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  
  
 This topic introduces guidelines and conventions for implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IToggleProvider>, including information about methods and properties. Links to additional references are listed at the end of the topic.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TogglePattern> control pattern is used to support controls that can cycle through a set of states and maintain a state once set. For examples of controls that implement this control pattern, see [Control Pattern Mapping for UI Automation Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/control-pattern-mapping-for-ui-automation-clients.md).  
  
<a name="Implementation_Guidelines_and_Conventions"></a>   
## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions  
 When implementing the Toggle control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:  
  
-   Controls that do not maintain state when activated, such as buttons, toolbar buttons, and hyperlinks, must implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IInvokeProvider> instead.  
  
-   A control must cycle through its <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ToggleState> in the following order: <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ToggleState.On>, <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ToggleState.Off> and, if supported, <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ToggleState.Indeterminate>.  
  
-   <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TogglePattern> does not provide a SetState(newState) method due to issues surrounding the direct setting of a tri-state CheckBox without cycling through its appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ToggleState> sequence.  
  
-   The RadioButton control does not implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IToggleProvider>, as it is not capable of cycling through its valid states.  
  
<a name="Required_Members_for_IToggleProvider"></a>   
## Required Members for IToggleProvider  
 The following properties and methods are required for implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IToggleProvider>.  
  
|Required member|Member type|Notes|  
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.TogglePattern.Toggle%2A>|Method|None|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.TogglePatternIdentifiers.ToggleStateProperty>|Property|None|  
  
 This control pattern has no associated events.  
  
<a name="Exceptions"></a>   
## Exceptions
