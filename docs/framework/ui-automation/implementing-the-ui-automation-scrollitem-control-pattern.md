# Implementing the UI Automation ScrollItem Control Pattern
> [!NOTE]
>  This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  
  
 This topic introduces guidelines and conventions for implementing the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IScrollItemProvider>, including information about properties, methods, and events. Links to additional references are listed at the end of the topic.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ScrollItemPattern> control pattern is used to support individual child controls of containers that implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IScrollProvider>. This control pattern acts as a communication channel between a child control and its container to ensure that the container can change the currently visible content (or region) within its viewport to display the child control. For examples of controls that implement this control pattern, see [Control Pattern Mapping for UI Automation Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/control-pattern-mapping-for-ui-automation-clients.md).  
  
<a name="Implementation_Guidelines_and_Conventions"></a>   
## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions  
 When implementing the Scroll Item control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:  
  
-   Items contained within a Window or Canvas control are not required to implement the IScrollItemProvider interface. As an alternative, however, they must expose a valid location for the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElementIdentifiers.BoundingRectangleProperty>. This will allow a UI Automation client application to use the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ScrollPattern> control pattern methods on the container to display the child item.  
  
<a name="Required_Members_for_IScrollItemProvider"></a>   
## Required Members for IScrollItemProvider  
 The following method is required for implementing the IScrollProvider interface.  
  
|Required members|Member type|Notes|  
|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IScrollItemProvider.ScrollIntoView%2A>|-   Method|None|  
  
 This control pattern has no associated properties or events.  
  
<a name="Exceptions"></a>   
## Exceptions  
 Providers must throw the following exceptions.  
  
|Exception Type|Condition|  
|--------------------|---------------|  
|<xref:System.InvalidOperationException>|If an item cannot be scrolled into view:<br /><br /> -   <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ScrollItemPattern.ScrollIntoView%2A>|
