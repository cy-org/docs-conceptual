# UI Automation and Microsoft Active Accessibility
> [!NOTE]
>  This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace. For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_aa](../../../includes/tlasharptla-aa-md.md)] was the earlier solution for making applications accessible. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] is the new accessibility model for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](../../../includes/tlasharptla-win-md.md)] and is intended to address the needs of assistive technology products and automated testing tools. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] offers many improvements over [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)].  
  
 This topic includes the main features of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] and explains how these features differ from [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)].  
  
<a name="Programming_Languages_compare"></a>   
## Programming Languages  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] is based on the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_com](../../../includes/tlasharptla-com-md.md)] with support for dual interfaces, and is therefore programmable in C/C++, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_vb6](../../../includes/tlasharptla-vb6-md.md)], and scripting languages. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] (including the client-side provider library for standard controls) is written in managed code, and UI Automation client applications are most easily programmed using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_vcshrp](../../../includes/tlasharptla-vcshrp-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualbnet](../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualbnet-md.md)]. UI Automation providers, which are interface implementations, can be written in managed code or in C/C++.  
  
<a name="Support_in_Windows_Presentation_Foundation_"></a>   
## Support in Windows Presentation Foundation  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] is the new model for creating user interfaces. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] elements do not contain native support for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)]; however, they do support [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], which includes bridging support for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] clients. Only clients written specifically for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] can take full advantage of the accessibility features of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], such as the rich support for text.  
  
<a name="Servers_and_Clients_compare"></a>   
## Servers and Clients  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)], servers and clients communicate directly, largely through the server's implementation of `IAccessible`.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], a core service lies between the server (called a provider) and the client. The core service makes calls to the interfaces implemented by providers and provides additional services such as generating unique runtime identifiers for elements. Client applications use library functions to call the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] service.  
  
 UI Automation providers can provide information to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] clients, and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] servers can provide information to UI Automation client applications. However, because [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] does not expose as much information as [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], the two models are not fully compatible.  
  
<a name="UI_Elements_compare"></a>   
## UI Elements  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] presents [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] elements either as an `IAccessible` interface or as a child identifier. It is difficult to compare two `IAccessible` pointers to determine if they refer to the same element.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], every element is represented as an <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> object. Comparison is done by using the equality operator or the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.Equals%2A> method, both of which compare the unique runtime identifiers of the elements.  
  
<a name="Tree_Views_and_Navigation_compare"></a>   
## Tree Views and Navigation  
 The [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] elements on the screen can be seen as a tree structure with the desktop as the root, application windows as immediate children, and elements within applications as further descendants.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)], many automation elements that are irrelevant to end users are exposed in the tree. Client applications have to look at all the elements to determine which are meaningful.  
  
 UI Automation client applications see the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] through a filtered view. The view contains only elements of interest: those that give information to the user or enable interaction. Predefined views of only control elements and only content elements are available; in addition, applications can define custom views. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] simplifies the task of describing the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to the user and helping the user interact with the application.  
  
 Navigation between elements, in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)], is either spatial (for example, moving to the element that lies to the left on the screen), logical (for example, moving to the next menu item, or the next item in the tab order within a dialog box), or hierarchical (for example, moving the first child in a container, or from the child to its parent). Hierarchical navigation is complicated by the fact that child elements are not always objects that implement `IAccessible`.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], all [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] elements are <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement> objects that support the same basic functionality. (From the standpoint of the provider, they are objects that implement an interface inherited from <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IRawElementProviderSimple>.) Navigation is mainly hierarchical: from parents to children, and from one sibling to the next. (Navigation between siblings has a logical element, as it may follow the tab order.) You can navigate from any starting-point, using any filtered view of the tree, by using the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TreeWalker> class. You can also navigate to particular children or descendants by using <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindFirst%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A>; for example, it is very easy to retrieve all elements within a dialog box that support a specified control pattern.  
  
 Navigation in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] is more consistent than in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)]. Some elements such as drop-down lists and pop-up windows appear twice in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] tree, and navigation from them may have unexpected results. It is actually impossible to properly implement [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] for a rebar control. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] enables reparenting and repositioning, so that an element can be placed anywhere in the tree despite the hierarchy imposed by ownership of windows.  
  
<a name="Roles_and_Control_Types"></a>   
## Roles and Control Types  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] uses the `accRole` property (`IAccessible::get_actRole`) to retrieve a description of the element's role in the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], such as ROLE_SYSTEM_SLIDER or ROLE_SYSTEM_MENUITEM. The role of an element is the main clue to its available functionality. Interaction with a control is achieved by using fixed methods such as `IAccessible::accSelect` and `IAccessible::accDoDefaultAction`. The interaction between the client application and the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] is limited to what can be done through `IAccessible`.  
  
 In contrast, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] largely decouples the control type of the element (described by the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationElementInformation.ControlType%2A> property) from its expected functionality. Functionality is determined by the control patterns that are supported by the provider through its implementation of specialized interfaces. Control patterns can be combined to describe the full set of functionality supported by a particular [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] element. Some providers are required to support a particular control pattern; for example, the provider for a check box must support the Toggle control pattern. Other providers are required to support one or more of a set of control patterns; for example, a button must support either Toggle or Invoke. Still others support no control patterns at all; for example, a pane that cannot be moved, resized, or docked does not have any control patterns.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] supports custom controls, which are identified by the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.ControlType.Custom> property and can be described by the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.LocalizedControlTypeProperty> property.  
  
 The following table shows the mapping of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] roles to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] control types.

<a name="States_and_Properties"></a>   
## States and Properties  
 In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)], elements support a common set of properties, and some properties (such as `accState`) must describe very different things, depending on the element's role. Servers must implement all methods of `IAccessible` that return a property, even those that are not relevant to the element.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] defines many more properties, some of which correspond to states in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)]. Some are common to all elements, but others are specific to control types and control patterns. Properties are distinguished by unique identifiers, and most properties can be retrieved by using a single method, <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.GetCurrentPropertyValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.GetCachedPropertyValue%2A>. Many properties are also easily retrievable from the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.Current%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.Cached%2A> property accessors.  
  
 A UI Automation provider does not have to implement irrelevant properties, but can simply return a `null` value for any properties it does not support. Also, the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] core service can obtain some properties from the default window provider, and these are amalgamated with properties explicitly implemented by the provider.  
  
 As well as supporting many more properties, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] supplies better performance by allowing multiple properties to be retrieved with a single cross-process call.  
  
 The following table shows the correspondence between properties in the two models.

<a name="uiautomation_events_compare"></a>   
## Events  
 The event mechanism in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], unlike that in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)], does not rely on Windows event routing (which is closely tied in with window handles) and does not require the client application to set up hooks. Subscriptions to events can be fine-tuned not just to particular events but to particular parts of the tree. Providers can also fine-tune their raising of events by keeping track of what events are being listened for.  
  
 It is also easier for clients to retrieve the elements that raise events, as these are passed directly to the event callback. Properties of the element are automatically prefetched if a cache request was active when the client subscribed to the event.  
  
 The following table shows the correspondence of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_aa](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-aa-md.md)] WinEvents and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] events.

## Security  
 Some `IAccessible` customization scenarios require wrapping a base `IAccessible` and calling through to it. This has security implications, since a partially trusted component should not be an intermediary on a code path.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] model removes the need for providers to call through to other provider code. The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] core service does all the necessary aggregation.
