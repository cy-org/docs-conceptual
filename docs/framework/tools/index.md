# .NET Framework Tools
The .NET Framework tools make it easier for you to create, deploy, and manage applications and components that target the .NET Framework.  
  
 Most of the .NET Framework tools described in this section are automatically installed with Visual Studio. (For installation information , see the [Visual Studio Downloads](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=325532).)  
  
 You can run all the tools from the command line with the exception of the Assembly Cache Viewer (Shfusion.dll). You must access Shfusion.dll from File Explorer.  
  
 The best way to run the command-line tools is by using the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio. These utilities enable you to run the tools easily, without navigating to the installation folder. For more information, see [Command Prompts](../../../docs/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Some tools are specific to either 32-bit computers or 64-bit computers. Be sure to run the appropriate version of the tool for your computer.
