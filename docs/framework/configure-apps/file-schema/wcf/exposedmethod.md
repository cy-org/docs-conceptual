# &lt;exposedMethod&gt;
Represents a COM+ method that is exposed when the interface on a COM+ component is exposed as a Web service.  
  
 \<system.ServiceModel>  
\<comContracts>  
\<comContract>  
\<methods>  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<comContracts>  
  <comContract>  
      <exposedMethods>  
         <exposedMethod name="string" />  
      </exposedMethods>  
  </comContract>  
</comContracts>  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|name|A string that contains the COM+ method that is exposed when the interface on a COM+ component is exposed as a Web service.|  
  
### Child Elements  
 None.  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<exposedMethods>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/exposedmethods.md)|A collection of [\<exposedMethod>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/exposedmethod.md) elements.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The COM+ integration configuration tool (ComSvcConfig.exe) can be used to add specific methods from a COM interface to appear on the generated service contract.  
  
 For example, you can use the following command to add the three named methods from the `IFinances` COM interface on the `ItemOrders`.Financial component, to the generated service contract.  
  
 `ComSvcConfig.exe /i /application:OnlineStore /contract:ItemOrders.Financial,IFinances.{TransferFunds,AddFunds,RemoveFunds} /hosting:complus`  
  
 When you also run the ComSvcConfig.exe, it then generates the following service contract listing the previously mentioned methods as [\<exposedMethod>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/exposedmethod.md) elements.  
  
```xml  
<comContract contractType="{C551FBA9-E3AA-4272-8C2A-84BD8D290AC7}" name="IFinances" namespace="http://contoso.com/services/financial">  
    <exposedMethod name="TransferFunds"/>  
    <exposedMethod name="AddFunds"/>  
    <exposedMethod name="RemoveFunds"/>  
</comContract>  
```  
  
 At service initialization time, the runtime attempts to generate a service contract by reflecting over and adding only the methods included in the list of [\<exposedMethod>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/exposedmethod.md) elements. A trace is produced for every interface method that is not included on the service contract.
