# &lt;resolver&gt;
Specifies a peer resolver that is used to resolve a peer mesh ID to a set of peer node addresses that represents several nodes that participate in the mesh.  
  
 \<system.ServiceModel>  
\<bindings>  
\<netPeerBinding>  
\<binding>  
\<resolver>  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<resolver mode="Auto/Custom/Pnrp"  
   referralPolicy="DoNotShare/Service/Share">  
</resolver>  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`mode`|A string that specifies whether the peer resolver instance associated with this service is either PNRP-specific, a custom resolver, or automatically determined. This attribute is of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers.PeerResolverMode>.|  
|`referralPolicy`|A string that specifies the way referrals are shared among peers. This attribute is of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers.PeerReferralPolicy>.|  
  
### Child Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<headers>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/headers.md)|Specifies settings for a custom peer resolver service.|  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<binding>](../../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md)|Defines all binding capabilities of the [\<netPeerTcpBinding>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/netpeertcpbinding.md).|  
  
## Remarks  
 A peer name resolver is a discovery service used by peer channels to find peer nodes that participate in a peer mesh. It is also used to "register" a node with a peer mesh, the mechanism by which the peer node becomes known and available from the peer mesh. For more information on peer resolvers, see [Peer Resolvers](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-resolvers.md).
