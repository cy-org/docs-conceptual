# &lt;windowsStreamSecurity&gt;
Specify Windows stream security settings of the custom binding.  
  
 \<system.serviceModel>  
\<bindings>  
\<customBinding>  
\<binding>  
\<windowsStreamSecurity>  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<windowsStreamSecurity protectionLevel="None/Sign/EncryptAndSign"/>  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|protectionLevel|Defines message-level security. Signing messages mitigates the risk of a third party tampering with the message while it is being transferred. Encryption provides data-level privacy during transport. Valid values include the following:<br /><br /> -   None: No protection.<br />-   Sign: Messages are signed.<br />-   EncryptAndSign: Messages are signed and encrypted.<br /><br /> The default is EncryptAndSign.<br /><br /> This attribute is of type <xref:System.Net.Security.ProtectionLevel>.|  
  
### Child Elements  
 None  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<binding>](../../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md)|Defines all binding capabilities of the custom binding.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Transports that use a stream-oriented protocol such as TCP and named pipes support stream-based transport upgrades. Specifically, WCF provides security upgrades. The configuration of this transport security is encapsulated by this configuration element  as well as by [\<sslStreamSecurity>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/sslstreamsecurity.md), which can be configured and added to a custom binding
