# &lt;rsa&gt;
A secure WCF client that connects to an endpoint with this identity verifies that the claims presented by the server contain a claim that contains the RSA public key used to construct this identity.  
  
 \<identity>  
\<rsa>  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<rsa value = "String" />  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|value|Optional String. The RSA public key value to be compared with on the client.|  
  
### Child Elements  
 None  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<identity>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/identity.md)|Specifies the identity of the service to be authenticated by the client.|  
  
## Remarks  
 A RSA check enables you to specifically restrict authentication to a single certificate based upon its RSA key or generated your own RSA key value. This enables stricter authentication of a specific RSA key at the expense of the service no longer working with existing clients if the RSA key value is changed.  
  
 For more information about using identity to validate a service to a client, see [Service Identity and Authentication](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/service-identity-and-authentication.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following configuration code specifies the public key value of an X.509 certificate that is used to authenticate a server.  
  
```xml  
<identity>  
  <rsa value = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"/>  
</identity>  
```
