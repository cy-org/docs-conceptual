# &lt;backupLists&gt;
Represents a configuration section for defining a set of backup services used in error handling. Each child element is a backup list that enumerates a set of endpoints that you would like the Routing Service to use in case the primary endpoint can't be reached. If the first endpoint in the list is down, the Routing Service will automatically fail-over to the next one in the list.  This gives you a quick way to add reliability to your application without having to teach your client application how to handle complex patterns or where all of your services are deployed.
