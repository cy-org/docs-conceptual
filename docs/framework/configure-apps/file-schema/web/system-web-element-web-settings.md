# &lt;system.web&gt; Element (Web Settings)
Contains information about how the ASP.NET hosting layer manages process-wide behavior.  
  
 \<configuration>  
\<system.web> Element (Web Settings)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
<system.web>  
</system.web>  
```  
  
## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
 None.  
  
### Child Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<applicationPool>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/web/applicationpool-element-web-settings.md)|Specifies configuration settings for IIS application pools in an aspnet.config file.|  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<configuration>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/configuration-element.md)|Specifies the root element in every configuration file that is used by the common language runtime and [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] applications.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `system.web` element and its child `applicationPool` element were added to the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] as of [!INCLUDE[net_v35SP1_short](../../../../../includes/net-v35sp1-short-md.md)]. When you run [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] or later versions in Integrated mode, this element combination lets you configure how ASP.NET manages threads and how it queues requests when ASP.NET is hosted in an IIS application pool. If you run [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] or later versions in Classic or ISAPI mode, these settings are ignored.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to configure ASP.NET process-wide behavior in the aspnet.config file when ASP.NET is hosted in an IIS application pool. The example assumes that IIS is running in Integrated mode and that the application is using the [!INCLUDE[net_v35SP1_short](../../../../../includes/net-v35sp1-short-md.md)] or a later version. This behavior does not occur in versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] earlier than the [!INCLUDE[net_v35SP1_short](../../../../../includes/net-v35sp1-short-md.md)]. The values in the example are the default values.  
  
```xml  
<configuration>  
  <system.web>  
    <applicationPool   
        maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU="5000"   
        maxConcurrentThreadsPerCPU="0"   
        requestQueueLimit="5000" />  
  </system.web>  
</configuration>  
```
