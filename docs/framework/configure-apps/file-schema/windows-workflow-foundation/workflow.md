# &lt;workflow&gt;
A configuration element that contains all queries for a specific workflow identified by the **a HYPERLINK "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.activities.tracking.configuration.profileworkflowelement.activitydefinitionid(VS.100).aspx" ctivityDefinitionId** property.  
  
 For more information in workflow tracking and its configuration, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md) and [Tracking Profiles](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md).

## Attributes and Elements  
 The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  
  
### Attributes  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|activityDefinitionId|A string that specifies the activity definition ID of the workflow being tracked.|  
  
### Child Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<activityScheduledQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/activityscheduledqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track an activity scheduled for execution by a parent activity. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to activity scheduled records.|  
|[\<activityStateQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/activitystatequeries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track life cycle changes of the activities that make up a workflow instance. For example, you may want to keep track of every time the "Send E-Mail" activity completes within a workflow instance. This query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to activity state record objects. The available states to subscribe to are specified in ActivityStates.|  
|[\<bookmarkResumptionQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/bookmarkresumptionqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track resumption of a bookmark within a workflow instance. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to bookmark resumption records.|  
|[\<cancelRequestedQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/cancelrequestedqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track requests to cancel a child activity by the parent activity. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to cancel request record objects.|  
|[\<customTrackingQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/customtrackingqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track events that you define in your code activities. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to custom tracking records.|  
|[\<faultPropagationQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/faultpropagationqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track the handling of faults that occur within an activity.  This event occurs each time a FaultHandler processes a fault. You should use such query to track the handling of faults that occur within an activity. The query is necessary for a  tracking participant to subscribe to fault propagation records.|  
|[\<workflowInstanceQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/workflowinstancequeries.md)|Represents a collection of configuration elements that track workflow instance life cycle changes such as a started or completed event.|  
  
### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[\<trackingProfile>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/trackingprofile.md)|Represents a configuration section for creating a subscription to workflow tracking records in a tracking participant. A tracking profile contains tracking queries that permit a tracking participant to subscribe to workflow events that are emitted when the state of a workflow instance changes at runtime. The queries defined within the tracking profile section define the kinds of events that are returned by the subscription.|  
  
## Remarks  
 Tracking profiles contains tracking queries that permit a tracking participant to subscribe to workflow events that are emitted when the state of a particular workflow instance changes at runtime. The workflow instance being tracked is identified by this configuration element.  
  
 Depending on your monitoring requirements you may write a profile that is very coarse, which subscribes to a small set of high-level state changes on a workflow. Conversely, you may create a very specific profile whose resulting events are rich enough to reconstruct a detailed execution flow later.  
  
 Tracking profiles are structured as declarative subscriptions for tracking records that allow you to query the workflow runtime for specific tracking records. There are a handful of query types that allow you subscribe to different classes of tracking records. For a complete list of queries, see the child element list of this topic and [Tracking Profiles](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md).  
  
 The following example shows a tracking profile in a configuration file that allows a tracking participant to subscribe to the `Started` and `Completed` workflow events.  
  
```xml  
<system.serviceModel>  
  <tracking>    
    <trackingProfile name="Sample Tracking Profile">  
      <workflow activityDefinitionId="*">  
         <workflowInstanceQueries>  
            <workflowInstanceQuery>  
            <states>  
              <state name="Started"/>  
              <state name="Completed"/>  
            </states>  
          </workflowInstanceQuery>  
        </workflowInstanceQueries>  
      </workflow>  
    </trackingProfile>          
   </profiles>  
  </tracking>  
</system.serviceModel>  
```
