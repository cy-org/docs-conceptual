# MEF for .NET for Windows Store Apps
<xref:System.Composition?displayProperty=fullName> and its child namespaces contain types for developing extensible [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps with Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF). These namespaces are part of the [!INCLUDE[net_win8_profile](../../../includes/net-win8-profile-md.md)] subset for the [!INCLUDE[win8](../../../includes/win8-md.md)] operating system.  
  
 These namespaces are not part of the core class library distributed with the .NET Framework. To install these namespaces, open your project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], choose **Manage NuGet Packages** from the **Project** menu, and search online for the Microsoft.Composition package.  
  
-   <xref:System.Composition?displayProperty=fullName> provides classes that constitute the core MEF for [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps.  
  
-   <xref:System.Composition.Convention?displayProperty=fullName> provides types that support using MEF with a convention-based configuration model.  
  
-   <xref:System.Composition.Hosting?displayProperty=fullName> provides MEF types that are useful to developers of host applications.  
  
-   <xref:System.Composition.Hosting.Core?displayProperty=fullName> provides MEF types used internally by the composition engine.
