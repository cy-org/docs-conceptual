# Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services
When you debug a Windows service application, your service and the **Windows Service Manager** interact. The **Service Manager** starts your service by calling the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method to return. If the method does not return in this time, the manager shows an error that the service cannot be started.  
  
 When you debug the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method as described in [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md), you must be aware of this 30-second period. If you place a breakpoint in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service.
