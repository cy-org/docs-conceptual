# Developing Windows Service Applications
Using Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] or the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SDK, you can easily create services by creating an application that is installed as a service. This type of application is called a Windows service. With framework features, you can create services, install them, and start, stop, and otherwise control their behavior.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  The Windows service template for C++ was not included in Visual Studio 2010. To create a Windows service, you can either create a service in managed code in Visual C# or Visual Basic, which could interoperate with existing C++ code if required, or you can create a Windows service in native C++ by using the [ATL Project Wizard](/cpp/atl/reference/atl-project-wizard).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)  
 Provides an overview of Windows service applications, the lifetime of a service, and how service applications differ from other common project types.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Creating a Windows Service Application in the Component Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/walkthrough-creating-a-windows-service-application-in-the-component-designer.md)  
 Provides an example of creating a service in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and Visual C#.  
  
 [Service Application Programming Architecture](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/service-application-programming-architecture.md)
