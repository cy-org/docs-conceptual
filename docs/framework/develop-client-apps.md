# Developing Client Applications with the .NET Framework
There are multiple ways to develop Windows-based applications with the .NET framework that run locally on users' computers or devices. This section contains topics that describe how to create Windows-based applications by using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or by using Windows Forms. However, you can also create web applications using the .NET Framework, and client applications for computers or devices that you make available through the Windows Store or Windows Phone Store.

 [Windows Presentation Foundation](../../docs/framework/wpf/index.md)  
 Provides information about developing applications by using WPF.
