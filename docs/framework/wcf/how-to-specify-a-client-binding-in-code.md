# How to: Specify a Client Binding in Code
In this example, a client is created to use a calculator service and the binding for that client is specified imperatively in code. The client accesses the `CalculatorService`, which implements the `ICalculator` interface, and both the service and the client use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class.  
  
 This procedure assumes that the calculator service is running. For information about building the service, see [How to: Specify a Service Binding in Configuration](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-specify-a-service-binding-in-configuration.md). It also uses the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md)[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides to automatically generate the client components. The tool generates the client code for accessing the service.  
  
 The client is built in two parts. Svcutil.exe generates the `ClientCalculator` that implements the `ICalculator` interface. This client application is then constructed by constructing an instance of `ClientCalculator` and then specifying the binding and the address for the service in code.  
  
 For the source copy of this example, see the [BasicBinding](../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basicbinding.md) sample.  
  
### To specify a custom binding in code  
  
1.  Use Svcutil.exe from the command line to generate code from service metadata.  
  
    ```  
    Svcutil.exe <service's Metadata Exchange (MEX) address or HTTP GET address>   
    ```  
  
2.  The client that is generated contains the `ICalculator` interface that defines the service contract that the client implementation must satisfy.

     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_CodeClientBinding#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeclientbinding/vb/client.vb#1)]  
  
3.  The generated client also contains the implementation of the `ClientCalculator`.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_CodeClientBinding#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeclientbinding/cs/client.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_CodeClientBinding#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeclientbinding/vb/client.vb#2)]  
  
4.  Create an instance of the `ClientCalculator` that uses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class in a client application, and then call the service operations at the specified address.  
  
     [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_CodeClientBinding#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeclientbinding/cs/client.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_CodeClientBinding#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeclientbinding/vb/client.vb#3)]  
  
5.  Compile and run the client.
