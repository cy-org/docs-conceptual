# Services and Transactions
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications can initiate a transaction from within a client and coordinate the transaction within the service operation. Clients can initiate a transaction and invoke several service operations and ensure that the service operations are either committed or rolled back as a single unit.  
  
 You can enable the transaction behavior in the service contract by specifying a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and setting its <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionIsolationLevel%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A> properties for service operations that require client transactions. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionAutoComplete%2A> parameter specifies whether the transaction in which the method executes is automatically completed if no unhandled exceptions are thrown. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] these attributes, see [ServiceModel Transaction Attributes](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/servicemodel-transaction-attributes.md).  
  
 The work that is performed in the service operations and managed by a resource manager, such as logging database updates, is part of the clientâ€™s transaction.  
  
 The following sample demonstrates usage of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> attributes to control service-side transaction behavior.  
  
```  
[ServiceBehavior(TransactionIsolationLevel = System.Transactions.IsolationLevel.Serializable)]  
public class CalculatorService: ICalculatorLog  
{  
    [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true,  
                           TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  
    public double Add(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        recordToLog(String.Format("Added {0} to {1}", n1, n2));  
        return n1 + n2;  
    }  
  
    [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true,   
                               TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  
    public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        recordToLog(String.Format("Subtracted {0} from {1}", n1, n2));  
        return n1 - n2;  
    }  
  
    [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true,   
                                       TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  
    public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        recordToLog(String.Format("Multiplied {0} by {1}", n1, n2));  
        return n1 * n2;  
    }  
  
    [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true,   
                                       TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  
    public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        recordToLog(String.Format("Divided {0} by {1}", n1, n2));  
        return n1 / n2;  
    }  
  
}  
```  
  
 You can enable transactions and transaction flow by configuring the client and service bindings to use the WS-AtomicTransaction protocol, and setting the [\<transactionFlow>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/transactionflow.md) element to `true`, as shown in the following sample configuration.  
  
```xml  
<client>  
    <endpoint address="net.tcp://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/service"   
          binding="netTcpBinding"   
          bindingConfiguration="netTcpBindingWSAT"   
          contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculatorLog" />  
</client>  
  
<bindings>  
    <netTcpBinding>  
        <binding name="netTcpBindingWSAT"  
                transactionFlow="true"  
                transactionProtocol="WSAtomicTransactionOctober2004" />  
     </netTcpBinding>  
</bindings>  
```  
  
 Clients can begin a transaction by creating a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> and invoking service operations within the scope of the transaction.  
  
```  
using (TransactionScope ts = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew))  
{  
    //Do work here  
    ts.Complete();  
}  
```
