# Extending Security
To accommodate new claim types and custom tokens, you can extend the security infrastructure of [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]. The topics in this section show you how this is done.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Security Architecture](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/16593476-d36a-408d-808c-ae6fd483e28f)  
 Walks through the architecture of the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] security system.  
  
 [Custom Credential and Credential Validation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-credential-and-credential-validation.md)  
 Explains how the Identity Model is used when validating custom credentials.  
  
 [Custom Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-tokens.md)  
 Issued tokens from a Security Token Service (STS) are typically SAML tokens. This topic explains how to create a custom token type.  
  
 [Custom Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-authorization.md)  
 Explains how to implement custom authorization.  
  
 [Overriding the Identity of a Service for Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/overriding-the-identity-of-a-service-for-authentication.md)  
 Describes how to override the identity of a service for authentication.  
  
 [How to: Create a Custom Client Identity Verifier](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-client-identity-verifier.md)  
 Demonstrates how to validate a custom endpoint identity.  
  
 [How to: Use Separate X.509 Certificates for Signing and Encryption](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-use-separate-x-509-certificates-for-signing-and-encryption.md)  
 Messages are typically signed and encrypted with a single certificate. This topic explains how two certificates can be used, when required.  
  
 [How to: Change the Cryptographic Provider for an X.509 Certificate's Private Key](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/change-cryptographic-provider-x509-certificate-private-key.md)  
 Explains how to change the cryptographic provider used to provide an X.509 certificate's private key and how to integrate the provider into the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] framework.
