# Operation Performance Counters
Operation performance counters are found under the `ServiceModelOperation 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe). Each operation has an individual instance. That is, if a given contract has 10 operations, 10 operation counter instances are associated with that contract. The object instances are named using the following pattern:  
  
```  
(ServiceName).(ContractName).(OperationName)@(first endpoint listener address)  
```  
  
 This counter enables you to measure how the call is being used and how well the operation is performing.  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.
