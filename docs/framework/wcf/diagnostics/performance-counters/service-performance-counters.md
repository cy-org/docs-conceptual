# Service Performance Counters
Service performance counters measure the service behavior as a whole and can be used to diagnose the performance of the whole service. They can be found under the `ServiceModelService 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe). The instances are named using the following pattern:  
  
```  
ServiceName@ServiceBaseAddress  
```  
  
> [!CAUTION]
>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.
