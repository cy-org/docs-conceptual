Counter Name: Security Calls Not Authorized Per Second.  
  
## Description  
 Number of calls that failed authorization in this operation in a second.  
  
 This counter is incremented when the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager.CheckAccess%2A> method returns `false`. It indicates that the incoming message is from a valid user and protected properly, but the user is not authorized to do specific tasks.  
  
 This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula.
