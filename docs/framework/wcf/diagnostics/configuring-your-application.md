# Configuring Your Application
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] uses the .NET configuration system and allows you to configure services at both the machine and application scope.  
  
 Configuration settings defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] are located in the `<system.serviceModel>` section group. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how to configure a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service, see the following topics:  
  
-   [Configuring Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuring-services.md)  
  
-   [\<system.serviceModel>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/system-servicemodel.md)  
  
 Application-defined configurations settings are defined in the `<appSettings>` section group. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] application settings in .NET configuration files, see [\<appSettings>](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=95159).  
  
## Using the Configuration Editor  
 The [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)][Configuration Editor Tool (SvcConfigEditor.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuration-editor-tool-svcconfigeditor-exe.md) allows administrators and developers to create and modify configuration settings for [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services using a graphical user interface. With this tool, you can manage settings for [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] bindings, behaviors, services, and diagnostics without directly editing XML configuration files.  
  
## Editing Configuration Files in Visual Studio  
 To edit the configuration file of a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service project in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], right click it in **Solution Explorer** and choose the **Edit WCF Config** context menu item. This launches the [Configuration Editor Tool (SvcConfigEditor.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuration-editor-tool-svcconfigeditor-exe.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you edit the configuration file of a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web Service project in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] by right-clicking it in **Solution Explorer**, notice that the **Edit WCF Config** context menu item is missing. To workaround this issue, click the **Tools** menu, and choose **WCF Service Config Editor**. After that, you can right-click a configuration file and use the **Edit WCF Config** context menu item.
