# System.ServiceModel.MessageProcessingPaused
System.ServiceModel.MessageProcessingPaused  
  
## Description  
 The threads were switched while processing a message.  
  
 Message processing can be paused by the following reasons:  
  
-   ConcurrencyMode is single or reentrant, and the service is processing another message.  
  
-   Transaction is enabled and the service is processing another transaction.  
  
-   Synchronization context is not current.
