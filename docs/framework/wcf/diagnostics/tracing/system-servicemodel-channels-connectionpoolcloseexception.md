# System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException
An exception occurred while closing the connections in this connection pool.  
  
## Description  
 This error level trace indicates that an error has occurred while closing the connection pools used by [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]â€™s connection pooling feature. One possible reason for this is an unsuccessful closure of a pooled connection, or a set of pooled connections within the CloseTimeout. When this exception is thrown, any remaining unclosed connections within that pool are aborted; unclosed connections within other pools are abandoned.
