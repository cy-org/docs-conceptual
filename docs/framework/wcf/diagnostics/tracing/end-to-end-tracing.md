# End-to-End Tracing
End to End (e2e) Tracing allows developers to follow the execution of code in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] infrastructure to investigate why a code path has failed, or to provide detailed tracing for capacity planning and performance analysis. [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides three correlation mechanisms to help diagnose the cause of an error: activities, transfers, and propagation.  
  
 See [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md) for a list of end-to-end tracing scenarios, and their respective activity and tracing design.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Activity](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/activity.md):  Describes activity traces in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing model.  
  
 [Transfer](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/transfer.md):  Describes transfer in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing model, and using transfer to correlate activities within endpoints.  
  
 [Propagation](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/propagation.md):  Describes activity propagation in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing model, and using propagation to correlate activities across endpoints.  
  
 [Trace Type Summary](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/trace-type-summary.md)  
  
 Provides a summary of all activity trace types
