# System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed
Cannot move or delete message.  
  
## Description  
 The trace indicates that a failure occurred when attempting to move, delete, or reject an MSMQ message.  
  
 MSMQ messages are employed by [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] (when used with either the NetMsmqBinding or the MsmqIntegrationBinding).This trace is related to the chosen value of the `ReceiveErrorHandling` property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding.  
  
 This trace is not indicative of an overall system failure. However, it indicates that the chosen poison message disposition failed for a message. See [Poison-Message Handling](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately.
