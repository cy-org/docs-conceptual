# Debugging on the Client
To make it easier for users to write client applications for your [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service, you can add the [\<serviceDebug>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicedebug.md) service behavior to the configuration file of your service. This behavior can be used to publish help pages, and return managed exception information in the details of SOAP faults returned to the client.
