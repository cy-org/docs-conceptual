# Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application
This section contains various topics that describe how you can use tracing to troubleshoot your application.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Recommended Settings for Tracing and Message Logging](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/recommended-settings-for-tracing-and-message-logging.md)  
 Describes suggested settings for production and debugging environments.  
  
 [Using Service Trace Viewer for Viewing Correlated Traces and Troubleshooting](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-service-trace-viewer-for-viewing-correlated-traces-and-troubleshooting.md)  
 Describes how you can use the Service Trace Viewer tool to view, correlate and analyze trace data.  
  
 [Significant Traces](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/significant-traces.md)  
 A list of major traces emitted by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [Debugging on the Client](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/debugging-on-the-client.md)  
 Enables clients to debug your application.  
  
 [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md)  
 Describes traces used for E2E [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] scenarios, for example, synchronous wsHttp request-replies, and asynchronous TCP one-way requests.  
  
 [Emitting User-Code Traces](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/emitting-user-code-traces.md)  
 Describes how to emit traces programmatically in user code, so that you can proactively create instrumentation data to be used later for diagnostic purpose, and in correlation with WCF traces.
