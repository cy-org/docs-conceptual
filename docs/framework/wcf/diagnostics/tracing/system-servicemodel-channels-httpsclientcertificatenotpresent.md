# System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsClientCertificateNotPresent
Client certificate is required. No certificate was found in the request.  
  
## Description  
 This trace indicates that the HTTPS listener received an HTTPS request that was not associated with a client certificate. Since the listener was configured to require client certificates on all HTTPS requests, the listener failed to validate the clientâ€™s authenticity.
