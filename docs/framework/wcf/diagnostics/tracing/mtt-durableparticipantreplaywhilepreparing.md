# Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing
The WS-AT protocol service received a Replay message from a durable participant, which did not respond to Prepare. Consequently, the transaction was aborted.  
  
## Description  
 Traced if a Replay message is received while a Durable participant is still Preparing. This is an illegal message for this state and the transaction is going to be aborted.  
  
## Troubleshooting  
 Receiving this error can indiate that a Durable participant (including Subordinate TransactionManagers) has recovered from failure, however it is unsure of the transaction outcome and request its status.
