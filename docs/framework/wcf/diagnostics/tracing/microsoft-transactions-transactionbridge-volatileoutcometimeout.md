# Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.VolatileOutcomeTimeout
The WS-AT protocol service timed out waiting for a response to an outcome message from a volatile participant. The transaction outcome may be in doubt if the participant returns.  
  
## Description  
 Traced when a Volatile participant has decided to Commit or Abort but has not responded to a Commit or Rollback request within a given amount of time.  
  
## Troubleshooting  
 Ensure that all Volatile participants are able to respond within the given amount of time. The default time period is 180 seconds.  If this is insufficient, increase the `VolatileOutcomeDelay` timer policy for WS-AT.
