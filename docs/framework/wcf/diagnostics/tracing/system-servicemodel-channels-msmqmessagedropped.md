# System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMessageDropped
MSMQ dropped the message.  
  
## Description  
 The trace indicates that an MSMQ message was dropped. MSMQ messages can be dropped when [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] (used with either the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding) is unable to process them. Such messages are referred to as poison messages.  
  
 A poison message is dropped when the `ReceiveErrorHandling` property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding is set to `Drop`. A dropped message is removed from the queue and is no longer recoverable.  
  
 See [Poison-Message Handling](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately.
