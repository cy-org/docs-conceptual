# Analytic Tracing with ETW
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] analytic tracing offers a way to capture diagnostic information during the execution of a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] analytic tracing events are emitted at key points in the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] stack to allow troubleshooting of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services in a production environment. Analytic tracing for [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services has minimal impact on the performance of a product server that hosts [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services as these events are very efficiently emitted to an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Analytic Tracing Overview](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-tracing-overview.md)  
 Discusses how [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] analytic tracing works in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  
  
 [Dynamically Enabling Analytic Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/dynamically-enabling-analytic-tracing.md)  
 Discusses how to enable or disable tracing dynamically using ETW.  
  
 [Configuring Message Flow Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/configuring-message-flow-tracing.md)  
 Describes how to configure message flow tracing.  
  
 [Analytic Trace Event Reference](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-trace-event-reference.md)  
 Shows a table of event IDs with their event levels, event messages and keywords.
