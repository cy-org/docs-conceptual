# WCF Feature Details
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] allows extensive control over the messaging functions of an application. The topics in this section go into detail about the available features. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] basic programming, see [Basic WCF Programming](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/basic-wcf-programming.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Workflow Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-services.md)  
 Describes how to create and configure workflow services.  
  
 [Endpoints: Addresses, Bindings, and Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/endpoints-addresses-bindings-and-contracts.md)  
 Describes how to control multiple aspects of your service.  
  
 [Data Transfer and Serialization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/data-transfer-and-serialization.md)  
 Describes how serialization of data can be tailored for interoperation or future compatibility.  
  
 [Sessions, Instancing, and Concurrency](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/sessions-instancing-and-concurrency.md)  
 Describes the instancing and session modes of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and how to select the right mode for your application.  
  
 [Transports](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transports.md)  
 Describes how to configure the transport layer, the lowest level of the channel stack.  
  
 [Queues and Reliable Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/queues-and-reliable-sessions.md)  
 Describes queues, which store messages from a sending application on behalf of a receiving application and later forward these messages to the receiving application.  
  
 [Transactions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transactions-in-wcf.md)  
 Explains how to create transacted operations that can be rolled back if needed.  
  
 [Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security.md)  
 Describes how [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] security helps you to create applications that have confidentiality and integrity. Authentication and authorization are also available, as are auditing features.  
  
 [Peer-to-Peer Networking](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-to-peer-networking.md)  
 Details how to create peer services and clients.

 Describes how to create a variety of clients that access services.  
  
 [Hosting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)  
 Describes hosting. A service can be hosted by another application, or it can be self-hosted.  
  
 [Interoperability and Integration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/interoperability-and-integration.md)  
 Describes how to use [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] to extend your existing logic rather than having to rewrite it if you have a substantial investment in component-based application logic hosted in COM+.  
  
 [WCF Web HTTP Programming Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-programming-model.md)  
 Describes the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web Programming Model that allows developers to expose [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service operations to non-SOAP endpoints.  
  
 [WCF Syndication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-syndication.md)
