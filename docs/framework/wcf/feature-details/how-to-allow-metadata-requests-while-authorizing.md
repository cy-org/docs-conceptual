# How To: Allow Metadata Requests While Authorizing
During custom authorization, it may be necessary to allow a request for metadata to be processed. The following topic walks through the steps to validate such a request.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] authorization, see [Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authorization-in-wcf.md).  
  
### To allow metadata requests during authorization  
  
1.  Create an extension of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager> class.  
  
2.  Override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager.CheckAccessCore%2A> method. The method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether authorization is allowed. Information about the current procedure is found in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext> passed as a parameter to the method.  
  
3.  In the override, check the contract name, namespace, and the action as shown in the following example. If the conditions are valid, then return `true.`  
  
4.  Use the extensibility point to employ the class. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][How to: Create a Custom Authorization Manager for a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-authorization-manager-for-a-service.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows an override of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager.CheckAccessCore%2A> method.
