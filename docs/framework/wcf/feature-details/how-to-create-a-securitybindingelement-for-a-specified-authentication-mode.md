# How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides several modes by which clients and services authenticate to one another. You can create security binding elements for these authentication modes by using static methods on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> class or through configuration, as shown in the following example.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] the 18 authentication modes, see [SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following code example shows methods for creating bindings for the various authentication modes.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Once an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> object is created, a number of properties are immutable, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.IssuedSecurityTokenParameters.KeyType%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement.MessageSecurityVersion%2A>. Calling `set` on such properties does not change them.
