# WCF Syndication
[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides support to easily work with syndication feeds in Atom, RSS or other custom formats, which allows you to read and create them as well as expose them on a service endpoint. The topics in this section describe this programming model for syndication in detail.
