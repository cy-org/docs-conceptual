# Transport Security
Transport security in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] depends on the binding selected. The transport that the binding implements determines the actual security mechanism. The topics in this section explain the mechanisms that are implemented and their options.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Transport Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-overview.md)  
 Explains the basics of transport security in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [HTTP Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/http-transport-security.md)  
 Explains how [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL, or HTTPS).  
  
 [Understanding HTTP Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-http-authentication.md)  
 Describes HTTP authentication schemes, such as Basic, Digest, NT LAN Manager (NTLM), and others.  
  
 [Using Impersonation with Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-impersonation-with-transport-security.md)  
 Explains the five levels of impersonation that are possible with transport security mode.  
  
 [How to: Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate.md)  
 Walks through the basics of configuring a port on a machine with an X.509 certificate for SSL (transport) security.
