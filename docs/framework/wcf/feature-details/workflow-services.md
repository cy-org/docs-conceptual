# Workflow Services
[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] allows you to fully describe a workflow-based service declaratively in XAML. You can define a workflow that implements your service and describe endpoints the service exposes, all entirely in XAML. The topics in this section describe, in detail, the programming model that supports writing services declaratively.

 Describes the components involved in creating and hosting a workflow service.  
  
 [Messaging Activities](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/messaging-activities.md)  
 Discusses activities that allow workflows to send and receive messages.

 Describes how to synchronously call a workflow service from within another workflow service.  
  
 [Contract First Workflow Service Development](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/contract-first-workflow-service-development.md)  
 Describes creating a workflow service based on an existing service contract.  
  
 [How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-workflow-service-that-consumes-an-existing-service-contract.md)
