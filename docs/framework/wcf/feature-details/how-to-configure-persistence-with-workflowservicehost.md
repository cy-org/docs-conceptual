# How to: Configure Persistence with WorkflowServiceHost
This topic describes how to configure the SQL Workflow Instance Store feature to enable persistence for workflows hosted in <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> by using a configuration file. Before using the SQL Workflow Instance Store feature you must create a SQL database that is used to persist workflow instances. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][How to: Enable SQL Persistence for Workflows and Workflow Services](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-enable-sql-persistence-for-workflows-and-workflow-services.md).  
  
### To Configure the SQL Workflow Instance Store in Configuration  
  
1.  The properties of the SQL workflow instance store can be configured through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.SqlWorkflowInstanceStoreBehavior>, a service behavior that allows you to change the settings through XML configuration. The following configuration example shows how to configure the SQL workflow instance store by using the <`sqlWorkflowInstanceStore`> behavior element in a configuration file.  
  
    ```xml  
    <serviceBehaviors>  
        <behavior name="">  
            <sqlWorkflowInstanceStore   
                 connectionString="provider=System.Data.SqlClient;Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=DefaultPersistenceProviderDb;Integrated Security=True;Async=true"  
                 instanceEncodingOption="GZip | None"  
                 instanceCompletionAction="DeleteAll | DeleteNothing"  
                 instanceLockedExceptionAction="NoRetry | SimpleRetry | AggressiveRetry"  
                 hostLockRenewalPeriod="00:00:30"   
                 runnableInstancesDetectionPeriod="00:00:05">  
            <sqlWorkflowInstanceStore/>  
        </behavior>  
    </serviceBehaviors>  
    ```

    {  
       ConnectionString = "provider=System.Data.SqlClient;Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=DefaultPersistenceProviderDb;Integrated Security=True;Async=true",  
       InstanceEncodingOption = "GZip | None",  
       InstanceCompletionAction = "DeleteAll | DeleteNothing",  
       InstanceLockedExceptionAction = "NoRetry | SimpleRetry | AggressiveRetry",  
       HostLockRenewalPeriod = new TimeSpan(00, 00, 30),  
       RunnableInstancesDetectionPeriod = new TimeSpan(00, 00, 05)  
    });
