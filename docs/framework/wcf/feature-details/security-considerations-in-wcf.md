 [Information Disclosure](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/information-disclosure.md)  
 Discusses the various ways that information can be disclosed or attacked, and how to mitigate this.  
  
 [Elevation of Privilege](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/elevation-of-privilege.md)  
 Discusses the effects of giving an attacker authorization permissions beyond those initially granted and how to mitigate this.  
  
 [Denial of Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/denial-of-service.md)  
 Discusses what happens when a system is unable to process messages appropriately and how to mitigate it.  
  
 [Tampering](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/tampering.md)  
 Discusses the altering of messages or the delivery of messages and how to mitigate it.  
  
 [Replay Attacks](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/replay-attacks.md)
