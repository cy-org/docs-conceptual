# How to: Access Services with a Duplex Contract
One feature of [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] is the ability to create a service that uses a duplex messaging pattern. This pattern allows a service to communicate with the client through a callback. This topic shows the steps to create a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client in a client class that implements the callback interface.  
  
 A dual binding exposes the IP address of the client to the service. The client should use security to ensure that it connects only to services it trusts.  
  
 For a tutorial on creating a basic [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service and client, see [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md).  
  
### To access a duplex service  
  
1.  Create a service that contains two interfaces. The first interface is for the service, the second is for the callback. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] creating a duplex service, see [How to: Create a Duplex Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-duplex-contract.md).  
  
2.  Run the service.  
  
3.  Use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to generate contracts (interfaces) for the client. For information about how to do this, see  [How to: Create a Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client.md).  
  
4.  Implement the callback interface in the client class, as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```csharp  
    public class CallbackHandler : ICalculatorDuplexCallback  
    {  
        public void Result(double result)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("Result ({0})", result);  
        }  
        public void Equation(string equation)  
        {  
            Console.WriteLine("Equation({0})", equation);  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Public Class CallbackHandler   
    Implements ICalculatorDuplexCallback  
       Public Sub Result (ByVal result As Double)  
          Console.WriteLine("Result ({0})", result)  
       End Sub  
        Public Sub Equation(ByVal equation As String)  
            Console.Writeline("Equation({0})", equation)  
        End Sub  
    End Class  
    ```  
  
5.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext> class. The constructor requires an instance of the client class.  
  
    ```csharp  
    InstanceContext site = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim site As InstanceContext = New InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler())  
    ```  
  
6.  Create an instance of the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client using the constructor that requires an <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext> object. The second parameter of the constructor is the name of an endpoint found in the configuration file.  
  
    ```csharp  
    CalculatorDuplexClient wcfClient =   
    new CalculatorDuplexClient(site, "default")  
    ```  
  
    ```vb  
    Dim wcfClient As New CalculatorDuplexClient(site, "default")  
    ```  
  
7.  Call the methods of the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client as required.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates how to create a client class that accesses a duplex contract.  
  
 [!code-csharp[S_DuplexClients#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_duplexclients/cs/client.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[S_DuplexClients#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_duplexclients/vb/client.vb#1)]
