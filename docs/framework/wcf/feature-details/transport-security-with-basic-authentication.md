# Transport Security with Basic Authentication
The following illustration shows a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service and client. The server needs a valid X.509 certificate that can be used for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and the clients must trust the serverâ€™s certificate. Further, the Web service already has an SSL implementation that can be used. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] enabling basic authentication on Internet Information Services (IIS), see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=83822](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=83822).

## Service  
 The following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:  
  
-   Create a stand-alone service using the code with no configuration.  
  
-   Create a service using the supplied configuration, but do not define any endpoints.  
  
### Code  
 The following code shows how to create a service endpoint that uses a Windows domain user name and password for transfer security. Note that the service requires an X.509 certificate to authenticate to the client. For more information, see [Working with Certificates](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md) and [How to: Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate.md).

 [!code-vb[C_SecurityScenarios#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#1)]  
  
## Configuration  
 The following configures a service to use basic authentication with transport-level security:  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<configuration>  
    <system.serviceModel>  
        <bindings>  
            <wsHttpBinding>  
                <binding name="UsernameWithTransport">  
                    <security mode="Transport">  
                        <transport clientCredentialType="Basic" />  
                    </security>  
                </binding>  
            </wsHttpBinding>  
        </bindings>  
        <services>  
            <service name="BasicAuthentication.Calculator">  
                <endpoint address="https://localhost/Calculator"  
                          binding="wsHttpBinding"   
                          bindingConfiguration="UsernameWithTransport"  
                          name="BasicEndpoint"   
                          contract="BasicAuthentication.ICalculator" />  
            </service>  
        </services>  
    </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
## Client  
  
### Code  
 The following code shows the client code that includes the user name and password. Note that the user must provide a valid Windows user name and password. The code to return the user name and password is not shown here. Use a dialog box or other interface to query the user for the information.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  User name and password can only be set using code.

 [!code-vb[C_SecurityScenarios#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#2)]  
  
### Configuration  
 The following code shows the client configuration.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot use configuration to set the user name and password. The configuration shown here must be augmented using code to set the user name and password.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
<configuration>  
  <system.serviceModel>  
    <bindings>  
      <wsHttpBinding>  
        <binding name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" >  
          <security mode="Transport">  
            <transport clientCredentialType="Basic" />  
          </security>  
        </binding>  
      </wsHttpBinding>  
    </bindings>  
    <client>  
      <endpoint address="https://machineName/Calculator"   
                binding="wsHttpBinding"  
                bindingConfiguration="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator"   
                contract="ICalculator"  
                name="WSHttpBinding_ICalculator" />  
    </client>  
  </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```
