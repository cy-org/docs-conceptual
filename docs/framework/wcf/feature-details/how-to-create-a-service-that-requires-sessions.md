# How to: Create a Service That Requires Sessions
Sessions create a shared state between two or more endpoints that enables useful features such as callbacks, multi-hop security, and associations between clients and service instances. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] sessions in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, see [Using Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-sessions.md).  
  
### To specify that a contract require its binding to support sessions  
  
1.  Create a service contract with at least one operation. For an example of how to create a service contract, see [How to: Define a Service Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md).  
  
2.  Modify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> that declares the contract by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to either:  
  
    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode.Required?displayProperty=fullName> if this contract must be run within a session.  
  
    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode.Allowed?displayProperty=fullName> if this contract can be run within a session.  
  
    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode.NotAllowed?displayProperty=fullName> if this contract must not be run within a session.  
  
3.  Configure your service endpoint to use a binding that supports sessions. The following configuration example shows the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding?displayProperty=fullName>, which supports a WS`-`ReliableMessaging session.  
  
     [!code-xml[SCA.Session#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/sca.session/cs/hostapplication.exe.config#2)]   
  
## Example  
 The following example code shows how to specify a contract-level session requirement and use a configuration file to support that requirement with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding?displayProperty=fullName> binding.

 [!code-xml[SCA.Session#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/sca.session/cs/hostapplication.exe.config#2)]
