# Using WS-AtomicTransaction
WS-AtomicTransaction (WS-AT) is an interoperable transaction protocol. It enables you to flow distributed transactions by using Web service messages, and coordinate in an interoperable manner between heterogeneous transaction infrastructures. WS-AT uses the two-phase commit protocol to drive an atomic outcome between distributed applications, transaction managers, and resource managers.  
  
 The WS-AT implementation [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides includes a protocol service built into the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) transaction manager. Using WS-AT, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications can flow transactions to other applications, including interoperable Web services built using third-party technology.  
  
 When flowing a transaction between a client application and a server application, the transaction protocol used is determined by the binding that the server exposes on the endpoint the client selected. Some [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] system-provided bindings default to specifying the `OleTransactions` protocol as the transaction propagation format, while others default to specifying WS-AT. You can also programmatically modify the choice of transaction protocol inside a given binding.  
  
 The choice of protocol influences:  
  
-   The format of the message headers used to flow the transaction from client to server.  
  
-   The network protocol used to run the two-phase commit protocol between the client's transaction manager and the server's transaction, in order to resolve the outcome of the transaction.  
  
 If the server and client are written using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], you do not need to use WS-AT. Instead, you can use the default settings of `NetTcpBinding` with the `TransactionFlow` attribute enabled, which will use the `OleTransactions` protocol instead. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][\<netTcpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/nettcpbinding.md). Otherwise, if you are flowing transactions to Web services built on third-party technologies, you must use WS-AT.
