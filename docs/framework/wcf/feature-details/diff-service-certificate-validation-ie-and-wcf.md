# Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF
Because of difference between the way Internet Explorer and [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] validate service certificates when HTTPS is used, it is possible that Internet Explorer will not be able to access the Help page or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) of a service even though a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client is able to successfully send messages to the service endpoints. This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the `ServerAuthentication` object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] does not enforce such a constraint. If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to access the service metadata.
