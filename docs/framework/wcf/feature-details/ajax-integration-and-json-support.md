# AJAX Integration and JSON Support
The [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] support for ASP.NET Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format allow [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services to expose operations to AJAX clients. AJAX clients are Web pages running JavaScript code and accessing these [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services using HTTP requests. The topics in this section provide information about this support and about how to implement it.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] ASP.NET AJAX and its integration with ASP.NET 2.0, see [ASP.NET AJAX Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=96725).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Creating WCF Services for ASP.NET AJAX](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/creating-wcf-services-for-aspnet-ajax.md)  
 Describes how an [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service can be exposed to AJAX clients by adding the appropriate AJAX endpoint either through configuration or by using a service host factory customized to generate a service host that configures the AJAX endpoint automatically.  
  
 [Creating WCF AJAX Services without ASP.NET](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/creating-wcf-ajax-services-without-aspnet.md)  
 Describes how to create an [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service without using ASP.NET.  
  
 [Support for JSON and Other Data Transfer Formats](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/support-for-json-and-other-data-transfer-formats.md)  
 Describes the support of the JSON format typically used (instead of XML) for messaging with ASP.NET AJAX services.  
  
 [How to: Migrate AJAX-Enabled ASP.NET Web Services to WCF](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-migrate-ajax-enabled-aspnet-web-services-to-wcf.md)  
 Describes how to migrate an AJAX-enabled ASP.NET Web service to a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web service.
