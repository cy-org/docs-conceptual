# How to: Exchange Messages with WCF Endpoints and Message Queuing Applications
You can integrate existing Message Queuing (MSMQ) applications with [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications by using the MSMQ integration binding to convert MSMQ messages to and from [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] messages. This allows you to call into MSMQ receiver applications from [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] clients as well as call into [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services from MSMQ sender applications.  
  
 In this section, we explain how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBinding> for queued communication between (1) a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client and an MSMQ application service written using System.Messaging and (2) an MSMQ application client and a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  
  
 For a complete sample that demonstrates how to call a MSMQ receiver application from a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client, see the [Windows Communication Foundation to Message Queuing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-to-message-queuing.md) sample.  
  
 For a complete sample that demonstrates how to call a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service from a MSMQ client, see the [Message Queuing to Windows Communication Foundation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-queuing-to-wcf.md) sample.  
  
### To create a WCF service that receives messages from a MSMQ client  
  
1.  Define an interface that defines the service contract for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that receives queued messages from a MSMQ sender application, as shown in the following example code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_MsmqToWcf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/cs/service.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[S_MsmqToWcf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/vb/service.vb#1)]  
  
2.  Implement the interface and apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> attribute to the class, as shown in the following example code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_MsmqToWcf#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/cs/service.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[S_MsmqToWcf#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/vb/service.vb#2)]  
  
3.  Create a configuration file that specifies the <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBinding>.  
  
  
  
4.  Instantiate a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object that uses the configured binding.  
  
  
  
### To create a WCF client that sends messages to a MSMQ receiver application  
  
1.  Define an interface that defines the service contract for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client that sends queued messages to the MSMQ receiver, as shown in the following example code.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/proxy.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[S_WcfToMsmq#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/vb/proxy.vb#6)]  
  
2.  Define a client class that the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client uses to call the MSMQ receiver.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/snippets.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[S_WcfToMsmq#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/vb/snippets.vb#2)]  
  
3.  Create a configuration that specifies use of the MsmqIntegrationBinding binding.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/snippets.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[S_WcfToMsmq#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/vb/snippets.vb#3)]  
  
4.  Create an instance of the client class and call the method defined by the message receiving service.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/client.cs#4)]
