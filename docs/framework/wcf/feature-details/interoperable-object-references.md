# Interoperable Object References
By default the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> serializes objects by value. You can use the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.IsReference%2A> property to instruct the Data Contract Serializer to preserve object references when serializing objects of the type.  
  
## Generated XML  
 As an example, consider the following object:  
  
```  
[DataContract]  
public class X  
{  
    SomeClass someInstance = new SomeClass();  
    [DataMember]  
    public SomeClass A = someInstance;  
    [DataMember]  
    public SomeClass B = someInstance;  
}  
  
public class SomeClass   
{  
}  
```  
  
 With <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.PreserveObjectReferences%2A> set to `false` (the default), the following XML is generated:  
  
```xml  
<X>  
   <A>contents of someInstance</A>  
   <B>contents of someInstance</B>  
</X>  
```  
  
 With <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer.PreserveObjectReferences%2A> set to `true`, the following XML is generated:  
  
```xml  
<X>  
   <A id="1">contents of someInstance</A>  
   <B ref="1" />  
</X>  
```  
  
 However, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.XsdDataContractExporter> does not describe the `id` and `ref` attributes in its schema, even when the `preserveObjectReferences` property is set to `true`.  
  
## Using IsReference  
 To generate object reference information that is valid according to the schema that describes it, apply the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute to a type, and set the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.IsReference%2A> flag to `true`. Using `IsReference` in the previous example class `X`:  
  
 `[DataContract(IsReference=true)] public class X`  
  
 `{`  
  
 `SomeClass someInstance = new SomeClass();`  
  
 `[DataMember]`  
  
 `public SomeClass A = someInstance;`  
  
 `[DataMember]`  
  
 `public SomeClass B = someInstance;`  
  
 `}`  
  
 `public class SomeClass`  
  
 `{`  
  
 `}`  
  
 The generated XML is as follows:  
  
 `<X>`  
  
 `<A id="1">`  
  
 `<Value>contents of A</Value>`  
  
 `</A>`  
  
 `<B ref="1">`  
  
 `</B>`  
  
 `</X>`  
  
 Using `IsReference` ensures compliance on message round-tripping. Without it, when a type is generated from schema, what is sent back as XML for that type is not necessarily compatible with the schema originally assumed. In other words, although the `id` and `ref` attributes were serialized, the original schema could have barred these attributes (or all attributes) from occurring in the XML. With `IsReference` applied to a data member, the member continues to be recognized as "referenceable" when roundtripped.
