# Context Exchange Correlation
Context correlation is based on the context exchange mechanism described in the [.NET Context Exchange Protocol Specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=166059). Context correlation uses a well-known context header or cookie to relate messages to the correct instance. To use context correlation, a context-based binding such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpContextBinding>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpContextBinding>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpContextBinding> must be used on the endpoint provided to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>. This topic explains how to use context correlation with messaging activities in a workflow service.  
  
## Using Context Correlation  
 Context correlation is used when a client must make repeated calls into a workflow service and the service is hosted using one of the context bindings. This type of correlation is initialized by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair in the workflow service. The context is sent back to the client together with the reply, and then the client attaches this context on subsequent calls to the service.  
  
### Configuring Context Correlation in a Workflow Service  
 Context correlation is initialized by using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ContextCorrelationInitializer> that is associated with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activity that replies to the initial incoming message. In the following example, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> is configured to initialize a context correlation.  
  
```csharp  
Variable<string> Item = new Variable<string>();  
Variable<CorrelationHandle> OrderHandle = new Variable<CorrelationHandle>();  
  
Receive StartOrder = new Receive  
{  
    CanCreateInstance = true,  
    ServiceContractName = "IOrderService",  
    OperationName = "StartOrder"  
};  
  
SendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  
{  
    Request = StartOrder,  
    CorrelationInitializers =  
    {  
        new ContextCorrelationInitializer  
        {  
            CorrelationHandle = OrderHandle  
        }  
    }  
};  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  In this example, there are actually two types of correlation being used: context correlation and request-reply correlation. The context correlation is used so that calls from clients are routed to the correct instance. The request-reply correlation is used by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activities together to implement the two-way operation modeled by these activities. In this example, only the context correlation is explicitly configured, and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is using the default request-reply correlation that is provided by the implicit <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> management of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>. When using the **ReceiveAndSendReply** activity template in the workflow designer, request-reply correlation is explicitly configured. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)]request-reply correlation and implicit correlation handle management, see [Request-Reply](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/request-reply-correlation.md) and [Correlation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation-overview.md). [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] the **ReceiveAndSendReply** activity template, see [ReceiveAndSendReply](/visualstudio/workflow-designer/receiveandsendreply-template-designer).  
  
 Subsequent <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activities in the workflow service can reference the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> that was initialized by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> in the previous example.  
  
```csharp  
Receive AddItem = new Receive  
{  
    ServiceContractName = "IOrderService",  
    OperationName = "AddItem",  
    CorrelatesWith = OrderHandle  
};  
```  
  
 The endpoint is then configured on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> to use a context-based binding, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpContextBinding>.  
  
```xml  
<endpoint  
  contract="IOrderContract"  
  binding = "basicHttpContextBinding"  
  address="http://localhost:8080/OrderService" />  
```  
  
### Configuring Context Correlation in a Workflow Client  
 When the client is another workflow, context correlation must be configured on the client as well. On the client workflow, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> pair that makes the initial call to the workflow service must be configured with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ContextCorrelationInitializer>.  
  
```csharp  
Variable<CorrelationHandle> cchandle = new Variable<CorrelationHandle>();  
Send request = new Send  
{  
    // Activity configuration omitted.  
};  
  
ReceiveReply reply = new ReceiveReply  
{  
    Request = request,  
    CorrelationInitializers =   
    {  
        new ContextCorrelationInitializer  
        {  
            CorrelationHandle = cchandle  
        }  
    }  
};  
```  
  
 After the correlation is initialized, subsequent <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> activities can use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> to invoke methods on the same service instance.  
  
```csharp  
Send request2 = new Send  
{  
    CorrelatesWith = cchandle,  
    // Remaining activity configuration omitted.  
};  
```  
  
 Note that in these examples, the context correlation has been explicitly configured. If the client workflow is not also hosted in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, then correlation must be explicitly configured, unless the activities are contained within a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] context correlation, see the [NetContextExchangeCorrelation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/93c74a1a-b9e2-46c6-95c0-c9b0e9472caf) sample.  
  
 If the client that is making calls to the workflow service is not a workflow, then it can still make repeated calls as long as it explicitly passes back the context that is returned from the first call to the workflow service. Proxies generated by adding a service reference in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] store and pass this context by default.
