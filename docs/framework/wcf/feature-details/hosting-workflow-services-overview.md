# Hosting Workflow Services Overview
Workflow services must be hosted to execute. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost> is the out-of-the-box workflow host that supports multiple instances, configuration, and WCF messaging (although the workflows aren’t required to use messaging in order to be hosted).  It also integrates with persistence, tracking, and instance control through a set of service behaviors.  Just like WCF’s <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost>, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost> can be self-hosted in any managed .NET application, or web-hosted (as a .xamlx file) in IIS / WAS.  Topics in this section describe how to host a workflow service.
