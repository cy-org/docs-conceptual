# How to: Make X.509 Certificates Accessible to WCF
To make an X.509 certificate accessible to [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)], application code must specify the certificate store name and location. In certain circumstances, the process identity must have access to the file that contains the private key associated with the X.509 certificate. To obtain the private key associated with an X.509 certificate in a certificate store, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] must have permission to do so. By default, only the owner and the System account can access the private key of a certificate.  
  
### To make X.509 certificates accessible to WCF  
  
1.  Give the account under which [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is running read access to the file that contains the private key associated with the X.509 certificate.  
  
    1.  Determine whether [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] requires read access to the private key for the X.509 certificate.  
  
         The following table details whether a private key must be available when using an X.509 certificate.  
  
        |X.509 certificate use|Private key|  
        |---------------------------|-----------------|  
        |Digitally signing an outbound SOAP message.|Yes|  
        |Verifying the signature of an inbound SOAP message.|No|  
        |Encrypting an outbound SOAP message.|No|  
        |Decrypting an inbound SOAP message.|Yes|  
  
    2.  Determine the certificate store location and name in which the certificate is stored.  
  
         The certificate store in which the certificate is stored is specified either in application code or in configuration. For example, the following example specifies that the certificate is located in the `CurrentUser` certificate store named `My`.  
  
         [!code-csharp[x509Accessible#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/x509accessible/cs/source.cs#1)]
         [!code-vb[x509Accessible#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/x509accessible/vb/source.vb#1)]  
  
    3.  Determine where the private key for the certificate is located on the computer by using the [FindPrivateKey](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/findprivatekey.md) tool.  
  
         The [FindPrivateKey](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/findprivatekey.md) tool requires the certificate store name, certificate store location, and something that uniquely identifies the certificate. The tool accepts either the certificate's subject name or its thumbprint as a unique identifier. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how to determine the thumbprint for a certificate, see [How to: Retrieve the Thumbprint of a Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-the-thumbprint-of-a-certificate.md).  
  
         The following code example uses the [FindPrivateKey](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/findprivatekey.md) tool to determine the location of the private key for a certificate in the `My` store in `CurrentUser` with a thumbprint of `46 dd 0e 7a ed 0b 7a 31 9b 02 a3 a0 43 7a d8 3f 60 40 92 9d`.  
  
        ```  
        findprivatekey.exe My CurrentUser -t "46 dd 0e 7a ed 0b 7a 31 9b 02 a3 a0 43 7a d8 3f 60 40 92 9d" -a  
        ```  
  
    4.  Determine the account that [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is running under.  
  
         The following table details the account under which [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is running for a given scenario.  
  
        |Scenario|Process identity|  
        |--------------|----------------------|  
        |Client (console or WinForms application).|Currently logged in user.|  
        |Service that is self-hosted.|Currently logged in user.|  
        |Service that is hosted in IIS 6.0 ([!INCLUDE[ws2003](../../../../includes/ws2003-md.md)]) or IIS 7.0 ([!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)]).|NETWORK SERVICE|  
        |Service that is hosted in IIS 5.X ([!INCLUDE[wxp](../../../../includes/wxp-md.md)]).|Controlled by the `<processModel>` element in the Machine.config file. The default account is ASPNET.|  
  
    5.  Grant read access to the file that contains the private key to the account that [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is running under, using a tool such as cacls.exe.  
  
         The following code example edits (/E) the access control list (ACL) for the specified file to grant (/G) the NETWORK SERVICE account read (:R) access to the file.  
  
        ```  
        cacls.exe "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys\8aeda5eb81555f14f8f9960745b5a40d_38f7de48-5ee9-452d-8a5a-92789d7110b1" /E /G "NETWORK SERVICE":R  
        ```
