# How to: Test the Discovery Proxy
This is the fourth of four topics that shows how to implement a discovery proxy. In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md), you implemented a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service. This topic describes how to verify the discovery proxy, the service, and the client application work as expected.  
  
### Run the Discovery Proxy  
  
1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.  
  
2.  You may see a dialog that says: Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program. If you see this message, click the **Unblock** button.  
  
3.  Within the command prompt, run the discovery proxy, DiscoveryProxy.exe.  
  
4.  The application should display the following text: `Proxy started. Hit Enter to exit`.  
  
### Run the Discoverable Service  
  
1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.  
  
2.  Within the command prompt, run the Service.exe discoverable service.  
  
3.  The DiscoveryProxy.exe should display the following text: `******* Adding the following service: ** [Service Contract Name] ** [Service Endpoint Addr] 3.******* Done *******` .  
  
### Run the Client Application  
  
1.  Open a command prompt.  
  
2.  Within the command prompt, run the client.exe application.  
  
3.  After a few seconds the client application displays the following text: Connecting to [Service-Endpoint].  
  
4.  The service.exe should then display the following text: Greeting request received, I will respond.  
  
5.  The client.exe should then display the following text: Hello Client!  
  
### Shut Down the Applications  
  
1.  Shut down the client application.  
  
2.  Shut down the service. The discovery proxy displays the following text: `******* Removing the following service: ** [Service Contract Name] ** [Service Endpoint Addr] 2.3.******* Done *******`.  
  
3.  Shut down the discovery proxy.
