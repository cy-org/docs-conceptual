# Secure Sessions
A feature of [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] is reliable sessions that guarantee messages are received in the order they were sent. The topics in this section discuss the security implications to consider when creating a reliable session. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] reliable sessions, see [Using Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-sessions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When impersonation is required on Windows XP, use a secure session without a stateful security context token (SCT). When stateful SCTs are used with impersonation, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][Unsupported Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/unsupported-scenarios.md).
