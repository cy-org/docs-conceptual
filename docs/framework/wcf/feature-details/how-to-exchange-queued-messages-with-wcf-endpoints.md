# How to: Exchange Queued Messages with WCF Endpoints
Queues ensure that reliable messaging can occur between a client and a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service, even if the service is not available at the time of communication. The following procedures show how to ensure durable communication between a client and a service by using the standard queued binding when implementing the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  
  
 This section explains how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> for queued communication between a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client and a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  
  
### To use queuing in a WCF service  
  
1.  Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>. Mark the operations in the interface that are part of the service contract with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> and specify them as one-way because no response to the method is returned. The following code provides an example service contract and its operation definition.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#1)]  
  
2.  When the service contract passes user-defined types, you must define data contracts for those types. The following code shows two data contracts, `PurchaseOrder` and `PurchaseOrderLineItem`. These two types define data that is sent to the service. (Note that the classes that define this data contract also define a number of methods. These methods are not considered part of the data contract. Only those members that are declared with the `DataMember` attribute are part of the data contract.)  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#2)]  
  
3.  Implement the methods of the service contract defined in the interface in a class.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#3)]  
  
     Notice the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> placed on the `SubmitPurchaseOrder` method. This specifies that this operation must be called within a transaction and that the transaction automatically completes when the method completes.  
  
4.  Create a transactional queue using <xref:System.Messaging>. You can choose to create the queue using Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Microsoft Management Console (MMC) instead. If so, make sure you create a transactional queue.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/hostapp.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/hostapp.vb#4)]  
  
5.  Define a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> in configuration that specifies the service address and uses the standard <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> binding. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] configuration, see [Configuring Windows Communication Foundation Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/13cb368e-88d4-4c61-8eed-2af0361c6d7a).  
  
  
  
6.  Create a host for the `OrderProcessing` service using <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> that reads messages from the queue and processes them. Open the service host to make the service available. Display a message that tells the user to press any key to terminate the service. Call `ReadLine` to wait for the key to be pressed and then close the service.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/hostapp.cs#6)]
     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/hostapp.vb#6)]  
  
### To create a client for the queued service  
  
1.  The following example shows how to run the hosting application and use the Svcutil.exe tool to create the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client.  
  
    ```  
    svcutil http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service  
    ```  
  
2.  Define a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> in configuration that specifies the address and uses the standard <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> binding, as shown in the following example.  
  
  
  
3.  Create a transaction scope to write to the transactional queue, call the `SubmitPurchaseOrder` operation and close the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client, as shown in the following example.  
  
     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/client.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/client.vb#8)]  
  
## Example  
 The following examples show the service code, hosting application, App.config file, and client code included for this example.  
  
 [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#9)]
 [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#9)]  
  
 [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/hostapp.cs#10)]
 [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/hostapp.vb#10)]  
  
  
  
 [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#12](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/client.cs#12)]
 [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#12](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/client.vb#12)]
