# Generating Data Type Classes from XML
[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] includes a new feature to generate data type classes from XML. This topic describes how to automatically generate data types for the MSDN Library RSS feed.  
  
### Obtaining the XML from the MSDN Library RSS feed  
  
1.  In Internet Explorer, navigate to the [MSDN RSS feed](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225209).  
  
2.  Right-click the page and select **View Source**.  
  
3.  Copy the text of the feed by pressing **Ctrl+A** to select all text, and **Ctrl+C** to copy.  
  
### Creating the data types  
  
1.  Open a code file where the proxy is to be used. This file should be part of a [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] project.  
  
2.  Place the cursor in a location in the file outside any existing classes.  
  
3.  Select **Edit**, **Paste Special**, **Paste XML as Classes**.  
  
4.  Classes called `rss`, `rssChannel`, `rssChannelImage`, and `rssChannelItem` are created with the necessary members for accessing the elements in the RSS feed.  
  
### Using the generated classes  
  
1.  Once the classes are generated, they can be used in code like any other classes. The following code example returns a new instance of the `rssChannelImage` class.  
  
    ```  
    var channelImage = new rssChannelImage()   
    {   
        title = "MyImage",   
        link = "http://www.contoso.com/images/channelImage.jpg",   
        url = "http://www.contoso.com/entries/myEntry.html"   
    };  
    ```
