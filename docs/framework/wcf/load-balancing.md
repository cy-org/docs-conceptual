# Load Balancing
One way to increase the capacity of [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications is to scale them out by deploying them into a load-balanced server farm. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications can be load balanced using standard load balancing techniques, including software load balancers such as Windows Network Load Balancing as well as hardware-based load balancing appliances.  
  
 The following sections discuss considerations for load balancing [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications built using various system-provided bindings.  
  
## Load Balancing with the Basic HTTP Binding  
 From the perspective of load balancing, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications that communicate using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> are no different than other common types of HTTP network traffic (static HTML content, ASP.NET pages, or ASMX Web Services). [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] channels that use this binding are inherently stateless, and terminate their connections when the channel closes. As such, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> works well with existing HTTP load balancing techniques.  
  
 By default, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> sends a connection HTTP header in messages with a `Keep-Alive` value, which enables clients to establish persistent connections to the services that support them. This configuration offers enhanced throughput because previously established connections can be reused to send subsequent messages to the same server. However, connection reuse may cause clients to become strongly associated to a specific server within the load-balanced farm, which reduces the effectiveness of round-robin load balancing. If this behavior is undesirable, HTTP `Keep-Alive` can be disabled on the server using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement.KeepAliveEnabled%2A> property with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding> or user-defined <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding>. The following example shows how to do this using configuration.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
<configuration>  
  
 <system.serviceModel>  
  <services>  
   <service   
     name="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService"  
     behaviorConfiguration="CalculatorServiceBehavior">  
     <host>  
      <baseAddresses>  
       <add baseAddress="http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service"/>  
      </baseAddresses>  
     </host>  
    <!-- configure http endpoint, use base address provided by host  
         And the customBinding -->  
     <endpoint address=""  
           binding="customBinding"  
           bindingConfiguration="HttpBinding"   
           contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />  
   </service>  
  </services>  
  
  <bindings>  
    <customBinding>  
  
    <!-- Configure a CustomBinding that disables keepAliveEnabled-->  
      <binding name="HttpBinding" keepAliveEnabled="False"/>  
  
    </customBinding>  
  </bindings>  
 </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
 Using the simplified configuration introduced in [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)], the same behavior can be accomplished using the following simplified configuration.  
  
```xml  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
<configuration>  
 <system.serviceModel>  
    <protocolMapping>  
      <add scheme="http" binding="customBinding" />  
    </protocolMapping>  
    <bindings>  
      <customBinding>  
  
      <!-- Configure a CustomBinding that disables keepAliveEnabled-->  
        <binding keepAliveEnabled="False"/>  
  
      </customBinding>  
    </bindings>  
 </system.serviceModel>  
</configuration>  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] default endpoints, bindings, and behaviors, see [Simplified Configuration](../../../docs/framework/wcf/simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md).  
  
## Load Balancing with the WSHttp Binding and the WSDualHttp Binding  
 Both the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding> can be load balanced using HTTP load balancing techniques provided several modifications are made to the default binding configuration.  
  
-   Turn off Security Context Establishment: this can be accomplished by the setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NonDualMessageSecurityOverHttp.EstablishSecurityContext%2A> property on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> to `false`. Alternatively, if security sessions are required, it is possible to use stateful security sessions as described in the [Secure Sessions](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/secure-sessions.md) topic. Stateful security sessions enable the service to remain stateless as all of the state for the security session is transmitted with each request as a part of the protection security token. Note that to enable a stateful security session, it is necessary to use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding> or user-defined <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding> as the necessary configuration settings are not exposed on <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding> that are provided by the system.  
  
-   Do not use reliable sessions. This feature is off by default.  
  
## Load Balancing the Net.TCP Binding  
 The <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> can be load balanced using IP-layer load balancing techniques. However, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> pools TCP connections by default to reduce connection latency. This is an optimization that interferes with the basic mechanism of load balancing. The primary configuration value for optimizing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> is the lease timeout, which is part of the Connection Pool Settings. Connection pooling causes client connections to become associated to specific servers within the farm. As the lifetime of those connections increase (a factor controlled by the lease timeout setting), the load distribution across various servers in the farm becomes unbalanced. As a result the average call time increases. So when using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> in load-balanced scenarios, consider reducing the default lease timeout used by the binding. A 30-second lease timeout is a reasonable starting point for load-balanced scenarios, although the optimal value is application-dependent. For more information about the channel lease timeout and other transport quotas, see [Transport Quotas](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-quotas.md).  
  
 For best performance in load-balanced scenarios, consider using <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpSecurity> (either <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.Transport> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential>).
