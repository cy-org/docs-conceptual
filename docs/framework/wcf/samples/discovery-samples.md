# Discovery (Samples)
This section contains samples related to the Discovery feature.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Announcements](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/announcements-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use announcements with the discovery feature.  
  
 [Asynchronous Find](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/asynchronous-find-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to perform an asynchronous find to search for all calculator services.  
  
 [Basic](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to make a service discoverable programmatically as well as search for that service using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DynamicEndpoint>.  
  
 [Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/configuration-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use a configuration file to make a service discoverable as well as how to use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DynamicEndpoint> through configuration to look for that service.  
  
 [Discovery Binding Element Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-binding-element-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a discovery binding element into a custom binding. This allows clients to discover a service when a channel is opened.  
  
 [Discovery Proxy Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-proxy-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create an implementation of a Discovery Proxy to store information about existing services and how clients can query that proxy for information.  
  
 [Discover a Service with Unique Listen Uri Mode Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discover-a-service-with-unique-listen-uri-mode-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to discover a service that has the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingContext.ListenUriMode%2A> property set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ListenUriMode.Unique>.  
  
 [Discovery with Scopes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-with-scopes-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use scopes to categorize discoverable endpoints as well how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> to perform an asynchronous search for endpoints.  
  
 [Custom Find Criteria](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-find-criteria.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom scope match using logic and how to implement a custom discovery service.  
  
 [Workflow Discovery Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/workflow-discovery-sample.md)  
 Demonstrates how to make a workflow service discoverable and how to author a custom code activity that searches for a particular service.  
  
 [Discovery Router Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-router-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to forward discovery messages to another endpoint.
