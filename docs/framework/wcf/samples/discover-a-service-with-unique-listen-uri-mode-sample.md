# Discover a Service with Unique Listen Uri Mode Sample
This sample demonstrates how to discover a service that has the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingContext.ListenUriMode%2A> property set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ListenUriMode.Unique>. When the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingContext.ListenUriMode%2A> property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ListenUriMode.Unique>, the ListenUri is ensured to be unique by either setting the port to be unique or for the path to be unique by appending a GUID.  
  
### Features on the Service  
 The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingContext.ListenUriMode%2A> property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ListenUriMode.Unique> for the TCP endpoint. The service is then made discoverable over a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.UdpDiscoveryEndpoint> endpoint.  
  
### Features on the Client  
 This client connects to the service using the correct `Via.Uri` by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient.Find%2A> method. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.FindResponse> that is returned from the method is then queried for whether it contains a valid <xref:System.ServiceModel.Endpoint.ListenUri%2A> and whether it is different than `Address.Uri`. The appropriate information is then passed to the `InvokeCalculatorService` method. In the `InvokeCalculatorService` method, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Endpoint.ListenUri%2A> was passed in by the caller, then a `ClientViaBehavior` with the correct `Via.Uri` is added to the client’s endpoint.  
  
##### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open UniqueListenUriMode.sln.  
  
2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  Run the service application, which is generated in the [solution base directory]\service\bin\debug folder.  
  
4.  Run the client application, which is generated in the [solution base directory]\Client\bin\debug folder.  
  
     The client locates the running service and writes to the console the metadata published by the service’s endpoint.
