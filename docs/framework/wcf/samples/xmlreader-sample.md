# XmlReader Sample
The XmlReader sample demonstrates the processing of a message body using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. The sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which implements a calculator service. An additional service operation, `Sum`, has been added that accepts a message that contains an array of values to add together. The service reads the message using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The calculator interface includes a service operation named `Sum` that accepts a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message> parameter, as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
public interface ICalculator  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Add(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Divide(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    Message Sum(Message message);  
}  
```  
  
 The client accesses `Sum` by first creating an array of integer values, then creating a message from the array, and then calling the `Sum` method using the created message, as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  
...  
// Call the Sum service operation.  
int[] values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
using (new OperationContextScope(client.InnerChannel))  
{  
    Message request = Message.CreateMessage(OperationContext.Current.OutgoingMessageHeaders.MessageVersion, "http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples/ICalculator/Sum", values);  
    Message reply = client.Sum(request);  
    int sum = reply.GetBody<int>();  
  
    Console.WriteLine("Sum(1,2,3,4,5) = {0}", sum);  
}  
```  
  
 In the service, the implementation of the service operation `Sum` accesses the message body using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object to iterate through the values to sum. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message.GetReaderAtBodyContents%2A> method is called to access the message body, as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
public int Sum(Message message)  
{  
    int sum = 0;  
    string text = "";  
  
    //The body of the message contains a list of numbers that are read  
    //directly using an XmlReader.  
    XmlReader body = message.GetReaderAtBodyContents ();  
    while (body.Read())  
    {  
        text = body.ReadString().Trim();  
        if (text.Length>0)  
        {  
            sum += Convert.ToInt32(text);  
        }  
    }  
    body.Close();  
    Message response = Message.CreateMessage(  
       "http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples/ICalculator/SumResponse",  
       sum);  
    return response;  
}  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the requests and responses of the operation are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
Sum(1,2,3,4,5) = 15  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.
