# TCP Activation
This sample demonstrates hosting a service that uses Windows Process Activation Services (WAS) to activate a service that communicates over the net.tcp protocol. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Services\Hosting\WASHost\TCPActivation`  
  
 The sample consists of a client console program (.exe) and a service library (.dll) hosted in a worker process activated by WAS. Client activity is visible in the console window.  
  
 The service implements a contract that defines a request-reply communication pattern. The contract is defined by the `ICalculator` interface, which exposes math operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide), as shown in the following sample code:  
  
```  
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]  
public interface ICalculator  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Add(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Divide(double n1, double n2);  
}  
```  
  
 The service implementation calculates and returns the appropriate result:  
  
```  
// Service class that implements the service contract.  
public class CalculatorService : ICalculator  
{  
    public double Add(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 + n2;  
    }  
    public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 - n2;  
    }  
    public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 * n2;  
    }  
    public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 / n2;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 The sample uses a variant of the net.tcp binding with TCP port sharing enabled and security turned off. If you want to use a secured TCP binding, change the server's security mode to the desired setting and re-run Svcutil.exe on the client to generate an update client configuration file.  
  
 The following sample shows the configuration for the service:  
  
```xml  
<system.serviceModel>  
  
    <services>  
      <service name="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService"  
               behaviorConfiguration="CalculatorServiceBehavior">  
        <!-- This endpoint is exposed at the base address provided by host: net.tcp://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc  -->  
        <endpoint binding="netTcpBinding" bindingConfiguration="PortSharingBinding"  
          contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />  
        <!-- the mex endpoint is explosed at net.tcp://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc/mex -->  
        <endpoint address="mex"  
                  binding="mexTcpBinding"  
                  contract="IMetadataExchange" />  
      </service>  
    </services>  
    <bindings>  
      <netTcpBinding>  
        <binding name="PortSharingBinding" portSharingEnabled="true">  
          <security mode="None" />  
        </binding>  
      </netTcpBinding>  
    </bindings>  
  
    <!--For debugging purposes set the includeExceptionDetailInFaults attribute to true-->  
    <behaviors>  
      <serviceBehaviors>  
        <behavior name="CalculatorServiceBehavior">  
          <serviceMetadata />  
          <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="False" />  
        </behavior>  
      </serviceBehaviors>  
    </behaviors>  
  
  </system.serviceModel>  
```  
  
 The client's endpoint is configured as shown in the following sample code:  
  
```xml  
<system.serviceModel>  
    <bindings>  
        <netTcpBinding>  
          <binding name="NetTcpBinding_ICalculator">  
            <security mode="None"/>  
          </binding>  
        </netTcpBinding>  
    </bindings>  
    <client>  
        <endpoint address="net.tcp://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc"  
            binding="netTcpBinding" bindingConfiguration="NetTcpBinding_ICalculator"  
            contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" name="NetTcpBinding_ICalculator" />  
    </client>  
</system.serviceModel>  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] is installed. [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] is required for WAS activation.  
  
2.  Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
     In addition, you must install the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] non-HTTP activation components:  
  
    1.  From the **Start** menu, choose **Control Panel**.  
  
    2.  Select **Programs and Features**.  
  
    3.  Click **Turn Windows Components on or Off**.  
  
    4.  Expand the **Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0** node and check the **Windows Communication Foundation Non-HTTP Activation** feature.  
  
3.  Configure WAS to support TCP activation.  
  
     As a convenience, the following two steps are implemented in a batch file called AddNetTcpSiteBinding.cmd located in the sample directory.  
  
    1.  To support net.tcp activation, the default Web site must first be bound to a net.tcp port. This can be done using Appcmd.exe, which is installed with the Internet Information Services 7.0 (IIS) management toolset. From an administrator-level command prompt, run the following command:  
  
        ```  
        %windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set site "Default Web Site" -+bindings.[protocol='net.tcp',bindingInformation='808:*']  
        ```  
  
        > [!TIP]
        >  This command is a single line of text. This command adds a net.tcp site binding to the default Web site listening on TCP port 808 with any hostname.  
  
    2.  Although all applications within a site share a common net.tcp binding, each application can enable net.tcp support individually. To enable net.tcp for the /servicemodelsamples application, run the following command from an administrator-level command prompt:  
  
        ```  
        %windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set app   
        "Default Web Site/servicemodelsamples" /enabledProtocols:http,net.tcp  
        ```  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  This command is a single line of text. This command enables the /servicemodelsamples application to be accessed using both http://localhost/servicemodelsamples and net.tcp://localhost/servicemodelsamples.  
  
4.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
5.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
     Remove the net.tcp site binding you added for this sample.  
  
     As a convenience, the following two steps are implemented in a batch file called RemoveNetTcpSiteBinding.cmd located in the sample directory.  
  
    1.  Remove net.tcp from the list of enabled protocols by running the following command from an administrator-level command prompt:  
  
        ```  
        %windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set app   
        "Default Web Site/servicemodelsamples" /enabledProtocols:http  
        ```  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  This command must be entered as a single line of text.  
  
    2.  Remove the net.tcp site binding by running the following command from an administrator-level command prompt:  
  
        ```  
        %windir%\system32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set site "Default Web Site"   
        --bindings.[protocol='net.tcp',bindingInformation='808:*']  
        ```  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  This command must be typed in as a single line of text.
