# Message Security Windows
This sample demonstrates how to configure a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> binding to use message-level security with Windows authentication. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md). In this sample, the service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS) and the client is a console application (.exe).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The default security for the [\<wsHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wshttpbinding.md) is message security using Windows authentication. The configuration files in this sample explicitly set the `mode` attribute of the [\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-wshttpbinding.md) to `Message` and the `clientCredentialType` attribute to `Windows`. These values are the default values for this binding, but they have been explicitly configured, as shown in the following sample configuration to demonstrate their use.  
  
```xml  
<bindings>  
    <wsHttpBinding>  
        <binding>  
            <security mode="Message">  
                <message clientCredentialType="Windows"/>  
            </security>  
        </binding>  
    </wsHttpBinding>  
</bindings>  
```  
  
 The client endpoint configuration consists of an absolute address for the service endpoint, the binding, and the contract. The client binding is configured with the appropriate `securityMode` and `authenticationMode`.  
  
```xml  
<system.serviceModel>  
  <client>  
    <endpoint address=  
            "http://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc"   
            binding="wsHttpBinding"   
            bindingConfiguration="Binding1"   
            contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />  
  </client>  
  
  <bindings>  
    <wsHttpBinding>  
      <!--   
      <!--The default security for the WSHttpBinding is-->  
      <!--Message security using Windows authentication. -->  
      <!--This configuration explicitly defines the security mode -->  
      <!--as Message and the clientCredentialType as Windows  -->  
      <!--for demonstration purposes. -->  
      <binding name="Binding1">  
        <security mode="Message">  
          <message clientCredentialType="Windows"/>  
        </security>  
      </binding>  
    </wsHttpBinding>  
  </bindings>  
</system.serviceModel>  
```  
  
 The service source code has been modified to demonstrate how the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext.ServiceSecurityContext%2A> can be used to access the identity of the caller.  
  
```  
public string GetCallerIdentity()  
{  
    // The Windows identity of the caller can be accessed on the ServiceSecurityContext.WindowsIdentity.  
    return OperationContext.Current.ServiceSecurityContext.WindowsIdentity.Name;  
}  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. The first method called - `GetCallerIdentity` - returns the name of the caller identity back to the client. Press ENTER in the console window to shut down the client.  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
