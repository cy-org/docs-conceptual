 [WS Transaction Flow](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ws-transaction-flow.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of a client-coordinated transaction and the client and server options for transaction flow using either the WS-Atomic Transaction or OleTransactions protocol.  
  
 [WS 2007 Federation HTTP Binding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ws-2007-federation-http-binding.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of <xref:System.ServiceModel.WS2007FederationHttpBinding>.  
  
 [WS Dual Http](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ws-dual-http.md)  
 Demonstrates how to configure the `WSDualHttpBinding` binding.  
  
 [MTOM Encoding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/mtom-encoding.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of the Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) message encoding with a WSHttpBinding.  
  
 [WSHttpBinding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wshttpbinding.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement a typical service and a typical client using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [WS Reliable Session](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ws-reliable-session.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of reliable sessions.  
  
 [WS Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ws-transport-security.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of SSL transport security with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> binding.  
  
 [Message Security Binding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-binding.md)  
 Demonstrates using message security in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [WS Transport With Message Credential](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ws-transport-with-message-credential.md)  
 This sample demonstrates the use of SSL transport security in combination with the client credential being carried in the message.
