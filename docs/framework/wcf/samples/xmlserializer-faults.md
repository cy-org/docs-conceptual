# XmlSerializer Faults
The <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> fault contract sample demonstrates how to communicate error information from a service to a client using the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>. The sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), with some additional code added to the service to convert an internal exception to a fault. The client attempts to perform division by zero to force an error condition on the service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The calculator contract has been modified to include a <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultContractAttribute> as shown in the following sample code. Also, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute> is used to enable serialization using the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.SupportFaults%2A> property is set to `true` on this attribute, which instructs the serializer to use the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> for reading and writing faults.  
  
```  
[XmlSerializerFormat(SupportFaults=true)]  
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]  
public interface ICalculator  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    int Add(int n1, int n2);  
  
    [OperationContract]  
    int Subtract(int n1, int n2);  
  
    [OperationContract]  
    int Multiply(int n1, int n2);  
  
    [OperationContract]  
    [FaultContract(typeof(MathFault))]  
    int Divide(int n1, int n2);  
}  
```  
  
 When generating code for the client proxy, you must apply the **/UseSerializerForFaults** flag to [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md).  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Contract\Service\XmlSerializerFaults`
