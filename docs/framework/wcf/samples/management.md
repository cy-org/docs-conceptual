# Management
This section contains samples that demonstrate [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] management.  
  
## In This Section  
 [WCF Services and Event Tracing for Windows](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-services-and-event-tracing-for-windows.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the analytic tracing in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] to emit events in Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).  
  
 [WCF Analytic Tracing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-analytic-tracing.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add your own tracing events into the stream of analytic traces that [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] writes to ETW in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  
  
 [Circular Tracing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/circular-tracing.md)  
 Demonstrates the implementation of a circular buffer trace listener.  
  
 [ETW Tracing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/etw-tracing.md)  
 Demonstrates how to implement End-to-End (E2E) tracing using Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).  
  
 [Extending Tracing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/extending-tracing.md)  
 Demonstrates how to extend the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] tracing feature by writing user-defined activity traces in client and service code.  
  
 [PII Security Lockdown](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/pii-security-lockdown.md)  
 Demonstrates how to control several security-related features of a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  
  
 [Using Performance Counters](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/using-performance-counters.md)  
 Demonstrates how to access [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] performance counters and how to create user-defined performance counters.  
  
 [Tracing and Message Logging](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/tracing-and-message-logging.md)  
 Demonstrates how to enable tracing and message logging.  
  
 [Security Validation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/security-validation.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use a custom behavior to validate services on a machine to ensure they meet specific criteria.  
  
 [WMI Provider](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wmi-provider.md)  
 Demonstrates how to gather data from [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services at runtime by using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider that is built into [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].
