# Data Binding in a Windows Forms Client
This sample demonstrates how to bind to data returned by a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service in a Windows Forms application.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this article.  
  
 This sample demonstrates a service that implements a contract that defines a request-reply communication pattern. The sample consists of a client Windows Forms application (.exe) and a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).  
  
 The contract is defined by the `IWeatherService` interface, which exposes an operation named `GetWeatherData`. This operation accepts an array of cities and returns an array of `WeatherData` objects that represent the high and low forecasted temperature for a city.  
  
 The data binding occurs on the client in the Windows Forms application. A `DataGridView` is defined in the Windows Forms designer, which is a graphical representation of the data. An intermediary named `BindingSource` is also created. The data source of `BindingSource` is set to the data array returned by the service. The purpose of the `BindingSource` is to provide a layer of indirection between the data and the data view. All interaction with the data, such as navigating, sorting, filtering, and updating, is accomplished with calls to the `BindingSource` component. To accomplish data binding to the `DataGridView`, the `datasource` of the `DataGridView` is then set to the `BindingSource` object. All of the data returned from the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service is then displayed graphically to the user.  Every time the user clicks the button, the returned data is automatically updated in the data-bound `DataGridView`.  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Scenario\DataBinding\WindowsForms`
