# Typed Client
The sample demonstrates how to obtain information from a typed client generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md). This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service. In this sample, the client is a console application (.exe) and the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The client's `Endpoint` property allows access to information about the service endpoint that the client is communicating withâ€”including address, binding and contract information. The client's `InnerChannel` property is an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.IClientChannel> that allows access to information about the underlying channel, such as its state and session identifier.  
  
```  
// Create a client.  
CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  
...  
Console.WriteLine("Client - endpoint:  " + client.Endpoint.Address);  
Console.WriteLine("Client - binding:  " + client.Endpoint.Binding.Name);  
Console.WriteLine("Client - contract: " + client.Endpoint.Contract.Name);  
  
IClientChannel channel = client.InnerChannel;  
Console.WriteLine("Client channel - state: " + channel.State);  
Console.WriteLine("Client channel - session identifier: " + channel.SessionId);  
  
//Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources.  
client.Close();  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Client - endpoint:  http://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc  
Client - binding:  WSHttpBinding  
Client - contract: ICalculator  
Client channel - state: Opened  
Client channel - session identifier: urn:uuid:ae16fbc4-2964-4e87-9fb1-c5aa78fc567e  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
