# Address Headers
The Address Headers sample demonstrates how clients can pass reference parameters to a service using [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The WS-Addressing specification defines the notion of an endpoint reference as a way to address a particular Web service endpoint. In [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], endpoint references are modeled using the `EndpointAddress` class - `EndpointAddress` is the type of the Address field of the `ServiceEndpoint` class.  
  
 Part of the endpoint reference model is that each reference can carry some reference parameters that add extra identifying information. In [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], these reference parameters are modeled as instances of `AddressHeader` class.  
  
 In this sample, the client adds a reference parameter to the `EndpointAddress` of the client endpoint. The service looks for this reference parameter and uses its value in the logic of its "Hello" service operation.  
  
## Client  
 For the client to send a reference parameter, it must add an `AddressHeader` to the `EndpointAddress` of the `ServiceEndpoint`. Because the `EndpointAddress` class is immutable, modification of an endpoint address must be done using the `EndpointAddressBuilder` class. The following code initializes the client to send a reference parameter as part of its message.  
  
```  
HelloClient client = new HelloClient();  
EndpointAddressBuilder builder =   
    new EndpointAddressBuilder(client.Endpoint.Address);  
AddressHeader header =   
    AddressHeader.CreateAddressHeader(IDName, IDNamespace, "John");  
builder.Headers.Add(header);  
client.Endpoint.Address = builder.ToEndpointAddress();  
```  
  
 The code creates an `EndpointAddressBuilder` using the original `EndpointAddress` as an initial value. It then adds a newly created address header; the call to `CreateAddressHeadercreates` a header with a particular name, namespace, and value. Here the value is "John". Once the header is added to the builder, the `ToEndpointAddress()` method converts the (mutable) builder back into an (immutable) endpoint address, which is assigned back to the client endpoint's Address field.  
  
 Now when the client calls `Console.WriteLine(client.Hello());`, the service is able to get the value of this address parameter, as seen in the resulting output of the client.  
  
 `Hello, John`  
  
## Server  
 The implementation of the service operation `Hello()` uses the current `OperationContext` to inspect the values of the headers on the incoming message.  
  
```  
string id = null;  
// look at headers on incoming message  
for (int i = 0;   
     i < OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageHeaders.Count;   
     ++i)  
{  
    MessageHeaderInfo h =   
        OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageHeaders[i];  
    // for any reference parameters with the correct name & namespace  
    if (h.IsReferenceParameter &&   
        h.Name == IDName &&   
        h.Namespace == IDNamespace)  
    {  
        // read the value of that header  
        XmlReader xr =   
OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageHeaders.GetReaderAtHeader(i);  
        id = xr.ReadElementContentAsString();  
    }  
}  
return "Hello, " + id;  
```  
  
 The code iterates over all the headers on the incoming message, looking for headers that are reference parameters with the particular name and. When the parameter is found, it reads the value of the parameter and stores it in the "id" variable.  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
