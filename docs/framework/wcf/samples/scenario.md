 Demonstrates how to enable [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] developers to work with deserialized, arbitrary JSON objects, without creating user-defined types.  
  
 [Trusted Facade Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/trusted-facade-service.md)  
 Demonstrates how to flow caller's identity information from one service to another using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] security infrastructure.
