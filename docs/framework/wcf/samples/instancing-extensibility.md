 [Durable Instance Context](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/durable-instance-context.md)  
 Demonstrates how to customize the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] runtime to enable durable instance contexts.  
  
 [Custom Lifetime](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-lifetime.md)  
 Demonstrates how to write a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] extension to provide custom lifetime services for shared [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service instances.  
  
 [Instancing Initialization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/instancing-initialization.md)  
 Demonstrates how to customize the initialization of an object.  
  
 [Pooling](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/pooling.md)  
 Demonstrates how to extend [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] to support object pooling.
