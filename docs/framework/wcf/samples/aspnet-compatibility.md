# ASP.NET Compatibility
This sample demonstrates how to enable [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Compatibility mode in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]. Services running in [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Compatibility mode participate fully in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application pipeline and can make use of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] features such as file/URL authorization, session state, and the <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> class. The <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> class allows access to cookies, sessions, and other [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] features. This mode requires that the bindings use the HTTP transport and the service itself must be hosted in IIS.  
  
 In this sample, the client is a console application (an executable) and the service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This sample requires a [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] application pool in order to run. To create a new application pool, or to modify the default application pool, follow these steps.  
>   
>  1.  Open **Control Panel**.  Open the **Administrative Tools** applet under the **System and Security** heading. Open the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** applet.  
> 2.  Expand the treeview in the **Connections** pane. Select the **Application Pools** node.  
> 3.  To set the default application pool to use [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] (which may cause incompatibility problems with existing sites), right-click the **DefaultAppPool** list item and select **Basic Settings…**. Set the **.Net Framework Version** pull-down to **.Net Framework v4.0.30128** (or later).  
> 4.  To create a new application pool that uses [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] (to preserve compatibility for other applications), right-click the **Application Pools** node and select **Add Application Pool…**. Name the new application pool, and set the **.Net Framework Version** pull-down to **.Net Framework v4.0.30128** (or later). After running the setup steps below, right-click the **ServiceModelSamples** application and select **Manage Application**, **Advanced Settings…**. Set the **Application Pool** to the new application pool.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.

>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.

 This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which implements a calculator service. The `ICalculator` contract has been modified as the `ICalculatorSession` contract to allow a set of operations to be performed, while keeping a running result.  
  
```  
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]  
public interface ICalculatorSession  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    void Clear();  
    [OperationContract]  
    void AddTo(double n);  
    [OperationContract]  
    void SubtractFrom(double n);  
    [OperationContract]  
    void MultiplyBy(double n);  
    [OperationContract]  
    void DivideBy(double n);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Result();  
}  
```  
  
 The service maintains state, using the feature, for each client as multiple service operations are called to perform a calculation. The client can retrieve the current result by calling `Result` and can clear the result to zero by calling `Clear`.  
  
 The service uses the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] session to store the result for each client session. This allows the service to maintain the running result for each client across multiple calls to the service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] session state and [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] sessions are very different things.  See the [Session](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/session.md) for details on [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] sessions.  
  
 The service has an intimate dependency on [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] session state and requires [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] compatibility mode to function correctly. These requirements are expressed declaratively by applying the `AspNetCompatibilityRequirements` attribute.  
  
```  
[AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode =  
                       AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required)]  
public class CalculatorService : ICalculatorSession  
{  
    double Result  
    {  // store result in AspNet Session  
       get {  
          if (HttpContext.Current.Session["Result"] != null)  
             return (double)HttpContext.Current.Session["Result"];  
          return 0.0D;  
       }  
       set  
       {  
          HttpContext.Current.Session["Result"] = value;  
       }  
    }  
    public void Clear()  
    {  
        Result = 0.0D;  
    }  
    public void AddTo(double n)  
    {  
        Result += n;  
    }  
    public void SubtractFrom(double n)  
    {  
        Result -= n;  
    }  
    public void MultiplyBy(double n)  
    {  
        Result *= n;  
    }  
    public void DivideBy(double n)  
    {  
        Result /= n;  
    }  
    public double Result()  
    {  
        return Result;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
0, + 100, - 50, * 17.65, / 2 = 441.25  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  After the solution has been built, run Setup.bat to set up the ServiceModelSamples Application in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]. The ServiceModelSamples directory should now appear as an [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] Application.  
  
4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
