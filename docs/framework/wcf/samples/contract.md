 [Data Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/data-contracts.md)  
 Demonstrates data contracts in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  
  
 [Message Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-contracts.md)

 [KnownAssemblyAttribute](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/knownassemblyattribute.md)  
 Demonstrates how to dynamically add known types during serialization and deserialization.  
  
 [Using DataContractSerializer and DataContractResolver to Provide the Functionality of NetDataContractSerializer](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/datacontractserializer-datacontractresolver-netdatacontractserializer.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> with an appropriate <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> provides the same functionality as <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer>.
