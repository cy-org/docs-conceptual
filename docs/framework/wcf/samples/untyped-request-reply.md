# Untyped Request/Reply
This sample demonstrates how to define operation contracts that use the Message class.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md). The service contract defines one operation that takes in a message type as an argument and returns a message. The operation collects all required data to compute the sum from the message body and then sends the sum as body in the return message.  
  
```  
[OperationContract(Action = CalculatorService.RequestAction, ReplyAction = CalculatorService.ReplyAction)]  
Message ComputeSum(Message request);  
```  
  
 On the service, the operation retrieves the array of integers passed in the input message and then computes the sum. To send a response message, the sample creates a new message with the appropriate message version and Action and adds the computed sum as its body. The following sample code demonstrates this.  
  
```  
public Message ComputeSum(Message request)  
{  
    //The body of the message contains a list of numbers which will be   
    //read as a int[] using GetBody<T>  
    int result = 0;  
  
    int[] inputs = request.GetBody<int[]>();  
    foreach (int i in inputs)  
    {  
        result += i;  
    }  
  
    Message response = Message.CreateMessage(request.Version,   
                                      ReplyAction, result);  
    return response;  
}  
```  
  
 The client uses code that is generated by [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to create a proxy to the remote service. To send a request message, the client must have the message version, which depends on the underlying channel. Thus, it creates a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContextScope> scoped to the proxy channel it created, which creates an <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext> with the correct message version populated in its `OutgoingMessageHeaders.MessageVersion` property. The client passes an input array as the body to the request message and then invokes the `ComputeSum` on the proxy. The client then retrieves the sum of the inputs it passed by accessing the `GetBody<T>` method on the reply message. The following sample code demonstrates this.  
  
```  
using (new OperationContextScope(client.InnerChannel))  
{  
    // Call the Sum service operation.  
    int[] values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  
    Message request = Message.CreateMessage(  
        OperationContext.Current.OutgoingMessageHeaders.MessageVersion,   
        RequestAction, values);  
    Message reply = client.ComputeSum(request);  
    int response = reply.GetBody<int>();  
  
    Console.WriteLine("Sum of numbers passed (1,2,3,4,5) = {0}",   
                                                       response);  
}  
```  
  
 This sample is a Web-hosted sample and so only the client executable must be run. The following is the sample output on the client.  
  
```  
Prompt>Client.exe  
Sum of numbers passed (1,2,3,4,5) = 15  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```

### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
