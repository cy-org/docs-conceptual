# Default NetTcpBinding
This sample demonstrates the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> binding. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service. In this sample, the service is self-hosted. Both the client and service are console applications.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Binding\Net\TCP\Default`  
  
 The binding is specified in the configuration files for the client and service. The binding type is specified in the `binding` attribute of the [\<endpoint>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/13aa23b7-2f08-4add-8dbf-a99f8127c017) element as shown in the following sample configuration.  
  
```xml  
<endpoint address=""  
          binding="netTcpBinding"  
          contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />  
```  
  
 The previous sample shows how to configure an endpoint to use the `netTcpBinding` binding with the default settings. If you want to configure the `netTcpBinding` binding and change some of its settings, it is necessary to define a binding configuration. The endpoint must reference the binding configuration by name with a `bindingConfiguration` attribute. In this sample, the binding configuration is named `Binding1` and is defined as shown in the following sample configuration.  
  
```xml  
<services>  
  <service name="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService"  
           behaviorConfiguration="CalculatorServiceBehavior">  
    ...  
    <endpoint address=""  
              binding="netTcpBinding"  
              bindingConfiguration="Binding1"   
              contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />  
    ...  
  </service>  
</services>  
  
<bindings>  
  <netTcpBinding>  
    <binding name="Binding1"   
             closeTimeout="00:01:00"  
             openTimeout="00:01:00"   
             receiveTimeout="00:10:00"   
             sendTimeout="00:01:00"  
             transactionFlow="false"   
             transferMode="Buffered"   
             transactionProtocol="OleTransactions"  
             hostNameComparisonMode="StrongWildcard"   
             listenBacklog="10"  
             maxBufferPoolSize="524288"   
             maxBufferSize="65536"   
             maxConnections="10"  
             maxReceivedMessageSize="65536">  
      <readerQuotas maxDepth="32"   
                    maxStringContentLength="8192"   
                    maxArrayLength="16384"  
                    maxBytesPerRead="4096"   
                    maxNameTableCharCount="16384" />  
      <reliableSession ordered="true"   
                       inactivityTimeout="00:10:00"  
                       enabled="false" />  
      <security mode="Transport">  
        <transport clientCredentialType="Windows" protectionLevel="EncryptAndSign" />  
      </security>  
    </binding>  
  </netTcpBinding>  
</bindings>  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press ENTER to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] 4.0 using the following command.  
  
    ```  
    %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.XXXXX\aspnet_regiis.exe /i /enable  
    ```  
  
2.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Because the server is self-hosted, you must specify an identity in the client's App.config file to run the sample in a cross-machine configuration.  
  
    ```xml  
    <client>  
      <endpoint name=""  
          address="net.tcp://servername:9000/servicemodelsamples/service"   
          binding="netTcpBinding"   
          contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator">  
            <identity>  
              <userPrincipalName value = "user_name@service_domain"/>  
            </identity>  
      </endpoint>  
    </client>  
    ```
