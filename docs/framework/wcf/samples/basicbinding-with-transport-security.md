# BasicBinding with Transport Security
This sample demonstrates the use of SSL transport security with the basic binding. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Binding\Basic\TransportSecurity`  
  
## Sample Details  
 By default, the basic binding supports HTTP communication. The sample shows how to enable transport security for the basic binding. Before you run the sample, you must create a certificate and assign it by using the Web Server Certificate Wizard.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The program code in the sample is identical to that of the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) service. The endpoint definition and binding definition in the configuration file settings are modified to enable secure communication, as shown in the following sample configuration.  
  
```xml  
<system.serviceModel>  
  <services>  
    <service type="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService"  
             behaviorConfiguration="CalculatorServiceBehavior">  
      <endpoint address=""  
                binding="basicHttpBinding"  
                bindingConfiguration="Binding1"   
                contract="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator" />  
    </service>  
   </services>  
  <bindings>  
    <basicHttpBinding>  
      <!-- Configure basicHttpBinding with Transport security -- >  
      <!-- mode and clientCredentialType set to None.-->  
      <binding name="Binding1">  
        <security mode="Transport">  
          <transport clientCredentialType="None"/>  
        </security>  
      </binding>  
    </basicHttpBinding>  
  </bindings>  
</system.serviceModel>  
```  
  
 Because the certificate used in this sample is a test certificate created with Makecert.exe, a security alert appears when you try to access an HTTPS: address in your browser, such as https://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc. To allow the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] client to work with a test certificate, some additional code is added to the client to suppress the security alert. This code, and the accompanying class, is not necessary when using real certificates.  
  
```  
// This code is required only for test certificates such as those   
// created by Makecert.exe.  
PermissiveCertificatePolicy.Enact(  
                           "CN=ServiceModelSamples-HTTPS-Server");  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] 4.0 using the following command:  
  
    ```  
    %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.XXXXX\aspnet_regiis.exe /i /enable  
    ```  
  
2.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
3.  Ensure that you have performed the [Internet Information Services (IIS) Server Certificate Installation Instructions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/iis-server-certificate-installation-instructions.md).  
  
4.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
5.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
