# Usage of Serialization Binder
This sample shows how to use the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder> to change the version of a generic type when it is serialized.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder>, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter>  
  
## Discussion  
 This sample shows how two entities that are targeting different versions of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] can communicate using the binary formatter and the serialization binder.  
  
 The development of this sample has been done using .NET Remoting. The sample consists of a server targeting [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)], which implements a contract with generic types, and two different clients, one targeting [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../../../../includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] and another targeting [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)].  
  
 The server attaches a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder> to the binary formatter to be able to change the version of the types accordingly on serialization, so both clients can deserialize those types properly.  
  
#### To set up, build and run the sample  
  
1.  To execute the client, right-click the solution, SBGenericsVTS (6 projects) and then select **Properties**.  
  
2.  In **Common Properties**, select **Startup Project**, then select **Multiple Startup Projects**.  
  
3.  Select **Server** first, then **Client20** and then **Client40**. Select the **Start** action to these three projects and leave the rest set to **None**.  
  
4.  Click **OK** and then press F5 to run the sample.
