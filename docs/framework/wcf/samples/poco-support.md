# POCO Support
This sample demonstrates the serialization support for unmarked types; that is, types to which serialization attributes have not been applied, sometimes referred to as Plain Old CLR Object (POCO) types. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> infers a data contract for all public unmarked types that have a default constructor. Data contracts allow you to pass structured data to and from services. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] unmarked types, see [Serializable Types](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/serializable-types.md).  
  
 This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), but uses complex numbers instead of primitive numeric types. It is also similar to the [Basic Data Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-data-contract.md) sample, except that the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attributes are not used.  
  
 The service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS) and the client is a console application (.exe).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The `ComplexNumber` class is used in the `ServiceContract`. The `ComplexNumber` type does not have the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attributes, as shown in the following sample code. By default, all public properties and fields are serialized.  
  
```  
public class ComplexNumber  
{  
    public double Real;  
    public double Imaginary;  
    public ComplexNumber()  
    {  
        Real = double.MinValue;  
        Imaginary = double.MinValue;  
    }  
    public ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary)  
    {  
        this.Real = real;  
        this.Imaginary = imaginary;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Contract\Data\POCO`
