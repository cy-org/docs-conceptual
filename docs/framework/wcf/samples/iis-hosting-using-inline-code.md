# IIS Hosting Using Inline Code
This sample demonstrates how to implement a service hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS), where the service code is contained in-line in a .svc file and is compiled on demand. Service code can also be implemented directly in source code files located in the application's \App_Code directory, or compiled into assembly deployed in \bin. This sample does not demonstrate these techniques.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.

 The sample demonstrates a typical service that implements a contract that defines a request-reply communication pattern. The service is hosted in IIS and the service code is entirely contained in the Service.svc file. The service is host-activated and compiled on-demand by the first message sent to the service. There is no pre-compilation necessary. The service implements an `ICalculator` contract as defined in the following code:  
  
```  
// Define a service contract.  
[ServiceContract(Namespace="http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]  
    public interface ICalculator  
{  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Add(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  
    [OperationContract]  
    double Divide(double n1, double n2);  
}  
```  
  
 The service implementation calculates and returns the appropriate result.  
  
```  
<%@ServiceHost language=c# Debug="true" Service="Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService" %>   
â€¦  
// Service class that implements the service contract.  
public class CalculatorService : ICalculator  
{  
    public double Add(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 + n2;  
    }  
    public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 - n2;  
    }  
    public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 * n2;  
    }  
    public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  
    {  
        return n1 / n2;  
    }  
}  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  After the solution has been built, run setup.bat to set up the ServiceModelSamples Application in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]. The ServiceModelSamples directory should now appear as an [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] Application.  
  
4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md). For an example on how to create a client application that can call this service, see [How to: Create a Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client.md).
