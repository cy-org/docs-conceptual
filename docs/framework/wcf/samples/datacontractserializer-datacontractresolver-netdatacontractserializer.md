# Using DataContractSerializer and DataContractResolver to Provide the Functionality of NetDataContractSerializer
This sample demonstrates how the use of <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> with an appropriate <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> provides the same functionality as <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer>. This sample shows how to create the appropriate <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> and how to add it to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>.  
  
## Sample details  
 <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> differs from <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> in one important way: <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> includes CLR type information in the serialized XML, whereas <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> does not. Therefore, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> can be used only if both the serializing and deserializing ends share the same CLR types. However, it is recommended to use <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> because its performance is better than <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer>. You can change the information that is serialized in <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> by adding a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> to it.  
  
 This sample consists of two projects. The first project uses <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> to serialize an object. The second project uses <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> with a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> to provide the same functionality as the first project.  
  
 The following code example shows the implementation of a custom <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> named `MyDataContractResolver` that is added to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> in the DCSwithDCR project.  
  
```  
class MyDataContractResolver : DataContractResolver  
{  
    private XmlDictionary dictionary = new XmlDictionary();  
  
    public MyDataContractResolver()  
    {  
    }  
  
    // Used at deserialization  
    // Allows users to map xsi:type name to any Type   
    public override Type ResolveName(string typeName, string typeNamespace, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver)  
    {  
        Type type = knownTypeResolver.ResolveName(typeName, typeNamespace, null);  
        if (type == null)  
        {  
            type = Type.GetType(typeName + ", " + typeNamespace);  
        }  
        return type;  
    }  
  
    // Used at serialization  
    // Maps any Type to a new xsi:type representation  
    public override void ResolveType(Type dataContractType, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver, out XmlDictionaryString typeName, out XmlDictionaryString typeNamespace)  
    {  
        knownTypeResolver.ResolveType(dataContractType, null, out typeName, out typeNamespace);  
        if (typeName == null || typeNamespace == null)  
        {  
            XmlDictionary dictionary = new XmlDictionary();  
            typeName = dictionary.Add(dataContractType.FullName);  
            typeNamespace = dictionary.Add(dataContractType.Assembly.FullName);  
        }  
    }  
}  
```  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the DCRSample.sln solution file.  
  
2.  Right-click the solution file and choose **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Solution Property Pages** dialog, under **Common Properties**, **Startup Project**, select **Multiple startup projects:**.  
  
4.  Next to the **DCSwithDCR** project, select **Start** from the **Action** dropdown.  
  
5.  Next to the **NetDCS** project, select **Start** from the **Action** dropdown.  
  
6.  Click **OK** to close the dialog.  
  
7.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
8.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.
