# Cryptographic Agility in WCF Security
This sample shows how to specify in a standard/custom algorithm to provide a cryptographic agile implementation in a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] client and service. The sample is composed of the following projects:  
  
 Service  
 This is a self-hosted [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that implements the `ICalculator` interface and secures the endpoint using the <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> with secure session and reliable session disabled. The service defines a custom `SecurityAlgorithmSuite` class to specify the cryptographic algorithms to be used for message security.  
  
 Client  
 This is a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]client that accesses the service after successful authentication. It invokes the operations exposed by the `ICalculator` interface and implemented by the service. The client also defines the same custom `SecurityAlgorithmSuite` class to specify the cryptographic algorithms to be used for message security.  
  
### To use this sample  
  
1.  Open the CryptoAgility.sln solution in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  
  
2.  Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution.  
  
3.  Open [!INCLUDE[fileExplorer](../../../../includes/fileexplorer-md.md)] and navigate to the \WCF\Basic\Security\CryptoAgility\Service\bin directory and run the service.exe file with administrator privileges by right-clicking service.exe and selecting **Run as administrator**.  
  
4.  Navigate to \WCF\Basic\Security\CryptoAgility\Client\bin directory and run the client.exe file normally.
