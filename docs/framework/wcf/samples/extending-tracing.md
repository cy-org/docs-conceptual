# Extending Tracing
This sample demonstrates how to extend the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing feature by writing user-defined activity traces in client and service code. This allows the user to create trace activities and group traces into logical units of work. It is also possible to correlate activities through transfers (within the same endpoint) and propagation (across endpoints). In this sample, tracing is enabled for both the client and the service. For more information about how to enable tracing in client and service configuration files, see [Tracing and Message Logging](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/tracing-and-message-logging.md).  
  
 This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md).

## Tracing and Activity Propagation  
 User-defined activity tracing allows the user to create their own trace activities to group traces into logical units of work, correlate activities through transfers and propagation, and lessen the performance cost of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] tracing (for example, the disk space cost of a log file).  
  
### Adding Custom Sources  
 User-defined traces can be added to both client and service code. Adding trace sources to the client or service configuration files allow for these custom traces to be recorded and displayed in the [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md). The following code shows how to add a user-defined trace source named `ServerCalculatorTraceSource` to the configuration file.  
  
```xml  
<system.diagnostics>  
    <sources>  
        <source name="System.ServiceModel" switchValue="Warning" propagateActivity="true">  
            <listeners>  
                <add type="System.Diagnostics.DefaultTraceListener" name="Default">  
                    <filter type="" />  
                </add>  
                <add name="xml">  
                    <filter type="" />  
                </add>  
            </listeners>  
        </source>  
        <source name="ServerCalculatorTraceSource" switchValue="Information,ActivityTracing">  
            <listeners>  
                <add type="System.Diagnostics.DefaultTraceListener" name="Default">  
                    <filter type="" />  
                </add>  
                <add name="xml">  
                    <filter type="" />  
                </add>  
            </listeners>  
        </source>  
    </sources>  
    <sharedListeners>  
       <add initializeData="C:\logs\ServerTraces.svclog" type="System.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener"  
        name="xml" traceOutputOptions="Callstack">  
            <filter type="" />  
        </add>  
    </sharedListeners>  
    <trace autoflush="true" />  
</system.diagnostics>....  
....  
```  
  
### Correlating Activities  
 To correlate activities directly across endpoints, the `propagateActivity` attribute must be set to `true` in the `System.ServiceModel` trace source. Also, to propagate traces without going through [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] activities, ServiceModel Activity Tracing must be turned off. This can be seen in the following code example.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Turning off ServiceModel Activity Tracing is not the same as having the trace level, denoted by the `switchValue` property, set to off.  
  
```xml  
<system.diagnostics>  
    <sources>  
      <source name="System.ServiceModel" switchValue="Warning" propagateActivity="true">  
  
    ...  
  
       </source>  
    </sources>  
</system.diagnostics>  
```  
  
### Lessening Performance Cost  
 Setting `ActivityTracing` to off in the `System.ServiceModel` trace source generates a trace file that contains only user-defined activity traces, without any of the ServiceModel activity traces included. This results in a log file of much smaller size. However, the opportunity to correlate [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] processing traces is lost.  
  
##### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
