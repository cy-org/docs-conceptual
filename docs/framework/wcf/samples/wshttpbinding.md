# WSHttpBinding
This sample demonstrates how to implement a typical service and a typical client using [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]. This sample consists of a client console program (client.exe) and a service library hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS). The service implements a contract that defines a request-reply communication pattern. The contract is defined by the `ICalculator` interface, which exposes math operations (add, subtract, multiply, and divide). The client makes synchronous requests to a given math operation and the service replies with the result. Client activity is visible in the console window.

 This sample exposes the `ICalculator` contract using the [\<wsHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wshttpbinding.md). The configuration of this binding has been expanded in the Web.config file.  
  
```xml
<bindings>  
  <wsHttpBinding>  
    <!--The following is the expanded configuration section for a-->  
    <!--WSHttpBinding. Each property is configured with the default-->   
    <!--value. See the ReliableSession, TransactionFlow, -->  
    <!--TransportSecurity, and MessageSecurity samples in the WS -->  
    <!--directory to learn how to configure these features. -->  
    <binding name="Binding1"  
              bypassProxyOnLocal="false"   
              transactionFlow="false"   
              hostNameComparisonMode="StrongWildcard"  
              maxBufferPoolSize="524288"   
              maxReceivedMessageSize="65536"  
              messageEncoding="Text"   
              textEncoding="utf-8"   
              useDefaultWebProxy="true"  
              allowCookies="false">  
      <reliableSession ordered="true"   
                       inactivityTimeout="00:10:00"  
                       enabled="false" />  
      <security mode="Message">  
        <message clientCredentialType="Windows"   
                 negotiateServiceCredential="true"  
                 algorithmSuite="Default"   
                 establishSecurityContext="true" />  
      </security>  
    </binding>  
  </wsHttpBinding>  
</bindings>  
```  
  
 On the base `binding` element, the `maxReceivedMessageSize` value lets you configure the maximum size of an incoming message (in bytes). The `hostNameComparisonMode` value lets you configure whether the hostname is considered when de-multiplexing messages to the service. The `messageEncoding` value lets you configure whether to use Text or MTOM encoding for messages. The `textEncoding` value lets you configure the character encoding for messages. The `bypassProxyOnLocal` value lets you configure whether to use an HTTP proxy for local communication. The `transactionFlow` value configures whether the current transaction is flowed (if an operation is configured for transaction flow).  
  
 On the [\<reliableSession>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/reliablesession.md) element, the enabled Boolean value configures whether reliable sessions are enabled. The `ordered` value configures whether message ordering is preserved. The `inactivityTimeout` value configures how long a session can be idle before being faulted.  
  
 On the [\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-wshttpbinding.md), the `mode` value configures which security mode should be used. In this sample, messages security is being used, which is why the [\<message>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/message-of-wshttpbinding.md) is specified inside the [\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-wshttpbinding.md).  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] 4.0 using the following command.  
  
    ```  
    %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.XXXXX\aspnet_regiis.exe /i /enable  
    ```  
  
2.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
