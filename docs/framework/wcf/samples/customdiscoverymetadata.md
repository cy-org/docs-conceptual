# CustomDiscoveryMetadata
This sample shows how to insert custom XML metadata into the discovery metadata for a discoverable endpoint exposed by a service. The sample then shows how a client can search for the service and extract this custom data. This sample consists of two projects, service and client.  
  
## Service  
 In the `main` method, the sample shows that an object of type <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> is populated with the desired fields and is added to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.EndpointDiscoveryBehavior>. This <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.EndpointDiscoveryBehavior> is added to a particular endpoint. When that particular endpoint is discovered, the discovery metadata contains the custom data that was added here.  
  
## Client  
 The sample shows the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient.Find%2A> method being called on a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient>. The resulting <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.FindResponse> is then queried for the appropriate and expected XML elements. These elements are then printed to the console.  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Load the project solution in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] and build the project.  
  
2.  First run the Service application, generated in [solution base directory]\service\bin\debug, and then run the Client application, generated in [solution base directory]\Client\bin\debug  
  
3.  Note that the service comes online, the client locates the service and prints the metadata published in the endpoint.
