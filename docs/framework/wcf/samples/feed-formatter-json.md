# Feed Formatter (JSON)
This sample shows how to serialize an instance of a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed> class in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format by using a custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeedFormatter> and the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer>.  
  
## Architecture of the Sample  
 The sample implements a class named `JsonFeedFormatter` that inherits from <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeedFormatter>. The `JsonFeedFormatter` class relies on the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> to read and write the data in JSON format. Internally, the formatter uses a custom set of data contract types named `JsonSyndicationFeed` and `JsonSyndicationItem` to control the format of the JSON data produced by the serializer. These implementation details are hidden from the end user, allowing calls to be made against the standard <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationItem> classes.  
  
## Writing JSON feeds  
 Writing a JSON feed can be accomplished by using the `JsonFeedFormatter` (implemented in this sample) with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> as shown in the following sample code.  
  
```  
//Basic feed with sample data  
SyndicationFeed feed = new SyndicationFeed("Custom JSON feed", "A Syndication extensibility sample", null);  
feed.LastUpdatedTime = DateTime.Now;  
feed.Items = from s in new string[] { "hello", "world" }  
select new SyndicationItem()  
{  
    Summary = SyndicationContent.CreatePlaintextContent(s)  
};  
  
//Write the feed out to a MemoryStream in JSON format  
DataContractJsonSerializer writeSerializer = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(JsonFeedFormatter));  
writeSerializer.WriteObject(stream, new JsonFeedFormatter(feed));  
```  
  
## Reading a JSON feed  
 Obtaining a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed> from a stream of JSON-formatted data can be accomplished with the `JsonFeedFormatter` as show in the following code.  
  
 `//Read in the feed using the DataContractJsonSerializer`  
  
 `DataContractJsonSerializer readSerializer = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(JsonFeedFormatter));`  
  
 `JsonFeedFormatter formatter = readSerializer.ReadObject(stream) as JsonFeedFormatter;`  
  
 `SyndicationFeed feedRead = formatter.Feed;`  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).
