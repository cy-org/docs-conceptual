# SystemWebRouting Integration Sample
This sample demonstrates the hosting layer’s integration with the classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace. The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace allow an application to use URLs that do not directly correspond to a physical resource. Using Web routing allows the developer to create virtual addresses for HTTP that are then mapped back to actual [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services. This is useful when a WCF service must be hosted without requiring a physical file or resource, or when services must be accessed with URLs that do not contain files such as .html or .aspx. This sample demonstrates how to utilize the <xref:System.Web.Routing.RouteTable> class to create virtual URIs that map to running services defined in global.asax. For this example, there are two RSS feeds created using WCF: a `movies` feed and a `channels` feed. The URLs to activate the services do not contain an extension and are registered in the `Application_Start` method of the `Global` class derived from the <xref:System.Web.HttpApplication.Application_Start> class.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace only work for services hosted over HTTP.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This sample only works in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)], as [!INCLUDE[iis60](../../../../includes/iis60-md.md)] uses a different method for supporting extension-less URLs.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WCF\Basic\Services\Hosting\WebRoutingIntegration`  
  
#### To use this sample  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the WebRoutingIntegration.sln file.  
  
2.  To run the solution and start the Web development server, press F5.  
  
     A directory listing for the sample appears. Note that there are no files with an .svc file extension.  
  
3.  In the address bar, add `movies` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/movies and press ENTER.  
  
     The movies feed appears in the browser.  
  
4.  In the address bar, add `channels` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/channels and press ENTER.  
  
     The channels feed appears in the browser.  
  
5.  Close the Web browser, by pressing ALT+F4.  
  
     If the development server has not exited, right-click the notification area icon and select **Stop**.  
  
#### To use this sample when hosted in IIS  
  
1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the WebRoutingIntegration.sln file.  
  
2.  Build the project, by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  
  
3.  Create a Web application in Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.  
  
    1.  In IIS Manager, right click the **Default Web Site** and select **Add an Application**.  
  
    2.  For the **alias**, type in `WebRoutingIntegration`.  
  
    3.  For the **Physical Path**, select the Service folder inside the project.  
  
    4.  Press **OK**.  
  
4.  Start the application, by right-clicking the Web application and selecting **Manage Application** and then **Browse**.  
  
5.  In the address bar, add `movies` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/movies and press ENTER.  
  
     The movies feed appears in the browser.  
  
6.  In the address bar, add `channels` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/channels and press ENTER.  
  
     The channels feed appears in the browser.  
  
7.  Close the Web browser, by pressing ALT+F4.  
  
 This sample demonstrates that the hosting layer is capable of composing with the classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace for routing the requests of services hosted over HTTP.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Please update the default application pool version to [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] if it’s set to version 2.
