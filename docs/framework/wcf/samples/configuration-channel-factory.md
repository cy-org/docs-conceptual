# Configuration Channel Factory
This sample covers the usage of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601>. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601> allows central management of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client configuration. This can also be useful in scenarios in which configuration is selected or changed after the application domain load time.  
  
## Demonstrates  
 <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601>  
  
## Discussion  
 This sample shows how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601> to add a particular configuration file to a client application, without having to use the default application configuration file.  
  
 The sample consists of two projects. The first project is a simple service that runs to reply to messages coming from the clients. The second project is a client application that builds two <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601> objects using a <xref:System.Configuration.ExeConfigurationFileMap> for the Test.config configuration file and uses them to communicate with the service. Both clients communicate with the service using the configuration specified in Test.config.  
  
 The following code adds a custom configuration file to a client application.  
  
```  
ExeConfigurationFileMap fileMap = new ExeConfigurationFileMap();  
fileMap.ExeConfigFilename = "Test.config";  
Configuration newConfiguration = ConfigurationManager.OpenMappedExeConfiguration(fileMap, ConfigurationUserLevel.None);  
  
ConfigurationChannelFactory<ICalculatorChannel> factory1 = new ConfigurationChannelFactory<ICalculatorChannel>("endpoint1", newConfiguration, new EndpointAddress("http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service"));  
ICalculatorChannel client1 = factory1.CreateChannel();  
```  
  
#### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] with administrator privileges.  
  
2.  Right-click the ConfigurationChannelFactory solution (2 projects) and then select **Properties**.  
  
3.  In **Common Properties**, select **Startup Project**, and then click **Multiple startup projects**.  
  
4.  Move the **Service** project to the beginning of the list, with the **Action ‘Start’**, and then move the **Client** project after the **Service** project, also with the **Action ‘Start’**, so the **Client** project is executed after the **Service** project.  
  
5.  Click **OK**, and then press F5 (or CTRL+F5) to run the sample.
