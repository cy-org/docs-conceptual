# Behaviors
This section contains samples that demonstrate [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service behaviors.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Concurrency](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/concurrency.md)  
 Demonstrates using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ConcurrencyMode> enumeration, which controls whether an instance of a service processes messages sequentially or concurrently.  
  
 [Default Service Behavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/default-service-behavior.md)  
 Demonstrates how service behavior settings can be configured.  
  
 [Instancing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/instancing.md)  
 Demonstrates the instancing behavior setting, which controls how instances of a service class are created in response to client requests.  
  
 [Metadata Publishing Behavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/metadata-publishing-behavior.md)  
 Demonstrates how to control the metadata publishing features of a service.  
  
 [Service Transaction Behavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-transaction-behavior.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of a client-coordinated transaction and the settings of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> to control service transaction behavior.  
  
 [Service Debug Behavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-debug-behavior.md)  
 Demonstrates how service debug behavior settings can be configured.  
  
 [Throttling](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/throttling.md)  
 Demonstrates the use of throttling controls.  
  
 [Behavior Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/behavior-security.md)  
 Demonstrates configuring service behavior security.
