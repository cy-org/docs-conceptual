# JSON Serialization
This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> to serialize and deserialize data in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. This serialization engine converts JSON data into instances of [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] types and back into JSON data. <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> supports the same types as <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>. The JSON data format is especially useful when writing Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)-style Web applications. AJAX support in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] is optimized for use with ASP.NET AJAX through the ScriptManager control. For examples of how to use [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] with ASP.NET AJAX, see the [AJAX Samples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f3fa45b3-44d5-4926-8cc4-a13c30a3bf3e).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 The sample uses a `Person` data contract to demonstrate serialization and deserialization.  
  
```  
[DataContract]  
    class Person  
    {  
        [DataMember]  
        internal string name;  
  
        [DataMember]  
        internal int age;  
    }  
```  
  
 To serialize an instance of the `Person` type to JSON, create the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> first and use the `WriteObject` method to write JSON data to a stream.  
  
```  
Person p = new Person();  
//Set up Person object...  
MemoryStream stream1 = new MemoryStream();  
DataContractJsonSerializer ser = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Person));  
ser.WriteObject(stream1, p);  
```  
  
 The memory stream contains valid JSON data.  
  
```json  
{"age":42,"name":"John"}  
```  
  
 The sample demonstrates deserializing from JSON data into an object. You then rewind the stream and call `ReadObject`.  
  
```  
Person p2 = (Person)ser.ReadObject(stream1);  
```  
  
 Examining the `p2` object reveals that the JSON data has been deserialized correctly.

#### To set up, build and run the sample  
  
1.  Build the solution JsonSerialization.sln as described in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
2.  Run the resulting console application.
