# Custom Binding Imperative
The sample demonstrates how to write imperative code to define and use custom bindings without using a configuration file or a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] generated client. This sample combines the features provided by the HTTP transport and the reliable session channel to create a reliable HTTP-based binding. This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  
  
 On both the client and the service, a custom binding is created that contains two binding elements (Reliable Session and HTTP):  
  
```  
ReliableSessionBindingElement reliableSession = new ReliableSessionBindingElement();  
reliableSession.Ordered = true;  
  
HttpTransportBindingElement httpTransport = new HttpTransportBindingElement();  
httpTransport.AuthenticationScheme = System.Net.AuthenticationSchemes.Anonymous;  
httpTransport.HostNameComparisonMode = HostNameComparisonMode.StrongWildcard;  
  
CustomBinding binding = new CustomBinding(reliableSession, httpTransport);  
```  
  
 On the service, the binding is used by adding an endpoint to the ServiceHost:  
  
```  
serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator), binding, "");  
```  
  
 On the client, the binding is used by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> to create a channel to the service:  
  
```  
EndpointAddress address = new EndpointAddress("http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service");  
ChannelFactory<ICalculator> channelFactory = new ChannelFactory<ICalculator>(binding, address);  
ICalculator channel = channelFactory.CreateChannel();  
```  
  
 This channel is then used to interact with the service:  
  
```  
// Call the Add service operation.  
double value1 = 100.00D;  
double value2 = 15.99D;  
double result = channel.Add(value1, value2);  
Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);  
```  
  
 When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  
  
```  
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  
  
Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  
```  
  
### To set up, build, and run the sample  
  
1.  Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  
  
2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  
  
3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples`  
>   
>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  
>   
>  `<InstallDrive>:\WF_WCF_Samples\WF\Basic\Binding\Custom\Imperative`
