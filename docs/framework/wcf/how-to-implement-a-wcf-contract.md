# How to: Implement a Windows Communication Foundation Service Contract
This is the second of six tasks required to create a basic [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service and a client that can call the service. For an overview of all six tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.  
  
 The next step in creating a WCF application is to implement the service interface. This involves creating a class called `CalculatorService` that implements the user-defined `ICalculator` interface..  
  
### To implement a WCF service contract  
  
1.  Open the Service1.cs or Service1.vb file and add the following code:  
  
    ```csharp  
    //Service1.cs  
    using System;  
    using System.Collections.Generic;  
    using System.Linq;  
    using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
    using System.ServiceModel;  
    using System.Text;  
  
    namespace GettingStartedLib  
    {  
        public class CalculatorService : ICalculator  
        {  
            public double Add(double n1, double n2)  
            {  
                double result = n1 + n2;  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Add({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
                // Code added to write output to the console window.  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
                return result;  
            }  
  
            public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  
            {  
                double result = n1 - n2;  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Subtract({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
                return result;  
            }  
  
            public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  
            {  
                double result = n1 * n2;  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
                return result;  
            }  
  
            public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  
            {  
                double result = n1 / n2;  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
                return result;  
            }  
        }  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```vb
    ‘Service1.vb  
    Imports System  
    Imports System.ServiceModel  
  
    Namespace GettingStartedLib  
  
        Public Class CalculatorService  
            Implements ICalculator  
  
            Public Function Add(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Add  
                Dim result As Double = n1 + n2  
                ' Code added to write output to the console window.  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Add({0},{1})", n1, n2)  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)  
                Return result  
            End Function  
  
            Public Function Subtract(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Subtract  
                Dim result As Double = n1 - n2  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Subtract({0},{1})", n1, n2)  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)  
                Return result  
  
            End Function  
  
            Public Function Multiply(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Multiply  
                Dim result As Double = n1 * n2  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2)  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)  
                Return result  
  
            End Function  
  
            Public Function Divide(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Divide  
                Dim result As Double = n1 / n2  
                Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2)  
                Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)  
                Return result  
  
            End Function  
        End Class  
    End Namespace  
    ```  
  
     Each method implements the calculator operation and writes some text to the console to make testing easier.  
  
## Example  
 The following code shows both the interface that defines the contract and the implementation of the interface.  
  
```csharp
// IService1.cs  
using System;  
using System.Collections.Generic;  
using System.Linq;  
using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
using System.ServiceModel;  
using System.Text;  
  
namespace GettingStartedLib  
{  
        [ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples")]  
        public interface ICalculator  
        {  
            [OperationContract]  
            double Add(double n1, double n2);  
            [OperationContract]  
            double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  
            [OperationContract]  
            double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  
            [OperationContract]  
            double Divide(double n1, double n2);  
        }  
}  
```  
  
```csharp
// Service1.cs  
using System;  
using System.Collections.Generic;  
using System.Linq;  
using System.Runtime.Serialization;  
using System.ServiceModel;  
using System.Text;  
  
namespace GettingStartedLib

    public class CalculatorService : ICalculator

            double result = n1 + n2;  
            Console.WriteLine("Received Add({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
            // Code added to write output to the console window.  
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
            return result;  
        }  
  
        public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  
        {  
            double result = n1 - n2;  
            Console.WriteLine("Received Subtract({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
            return result;  
        }  
  
        public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  
        {  
            double result = n1 * n2;  
            Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
            return result;  
        }  
  
        public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  
        {  
            double result = n1 / n2;  
            Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2);  
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result);  
            return result;  
        }  
    }  
}  
```

            Console.WriteLine("Received Multiply({0},{1})", n1, n2)  
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)  
            Return result  
  
        End Function  
  
        Public Function Divide(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double Implements ICalculator.Divide  
            Dim result As Double = n1 / n2  
            Console.WriteLine("Received Divide({0},{1})", n1, n2)  
            Console.WriteLine("Return: {0}", result)  
            Return result  
  
        End Function  
    End Class  
End Namespace  
```  
  
 Now the service contract is created and implemented. Build the solution to ensure there are no compilation errors and then proceed to [How to: Host and Run a Basic Service](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-host-and-run-a-basic-wcf-service.md) to run the service. For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshooting the Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/troubleshooting-the-getting-started-tutorial.md).  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 If you are using Visual Studio, on the Build menu click Build Solution (or press CTRL+SHIFT+B).
