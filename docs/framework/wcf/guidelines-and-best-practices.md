# Guidelines and Best Practices
This section contains topics that provide guidelines for creating [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Best Practices: Data Contract Versioning](../../../docs/framework/wcf/best-practices-data-contract-versioning.md)  
 Explains how and when to create data contracts that do not break when future versions are created.  
  
 [Service Versioning](../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-versioning.md)  
 Explains how to consider versioning in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]. After deployment, services (and the endpoints they expose) might need to be changed, for example, to satisfy changing business requirements or IT requirements, or to fix issues. Each change introduces a new version of the service.  
  
 [Load Balancing](../../../docs/framework/wcf/load-balancing.md)  
 Lists guidelines for load balancing with a Web farm.  
  
 [Controlling Resource Consumption and Improving Performance](../../../docs/framework/wcf/controlling-resource-consumption-and-improving-performance.md)  
 Describes the properties that are designed to help prevent undue resource consumption and improve security and points to more complete information about their use.  
  
 [Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce](../../../docs/framework/wcf/deploying-wcf-applications-with-clickonce.md)  
 Describes the considerations to be made when using the ClickOnce feature.
