# Creating the GamePieceCollection Class
The **GamePieceCollection** class derives from the generic List class, and introduces methods to more easily manage multiple **GamePiece** objects.  
  
## Creating the Code  
 The constructor of the **GamePieceCollection** class initializes the private member *capturedIndex*. This field is used to track which of the game pieces currently has the mouse capture.  
  
 [!code-csharp[ManipulationXNA#_GamePieceCollection_PrivateMembersAndConstructor](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/manipulationxna/cs/gamepiececollection.cs#_gamepiececollection_privatemembersandconstructor)]  
  
 The **ProcessInertia** and the **Draw** methods simplify the code needed in the game [Game.Update](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.update.aspx) and [Game.Draw](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.draw.aspx) methods by enumerating all of the game pieces in the collection and calling the respective method on each **GamePiece** object.  
  
 [!code-csharp[ManipulationXNA#_GamePieceCollection_ProcessInertiaAndDraw](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/manipulationxna/cs/gamepiececollection.cs#_gamepiececollection_processinertiaanddraw)]  
  
 The **UpdateFromMouse** method is also called during game update. It enables only one game piece to have the mouse capture by first checking to see if the current capture (if any) is still in effect. If so, no other piece is allowed to check for capture.  
  
 If no piece currently has the capture, the **UpdateFromMouse** method enumerates each game piece from last to first, and checks to see if that piece reports a mouse capture. If so, that piece becomes the current captured piece, and no further processing takes place. The **UpdateFromMouse** method checks the last item in the collection first so that if two pieces are overlapped, the one with the higher Z-order will obtain the capture. Z-order is not explicit nor changeable; it is governed simply by the order in which game pieces are added to the collection.
