# How to: Display Bound Data in a DataRepeater Control (Visual Studio)
The most common use of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater> control is to display bound data from a database or other data source.  
  
 In addition to bound controls, you may want to add other controls, such as a static label or an image that is repeated on each item in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater> control. For more information, see [How to: Display Unbound Controls in a DataRepeater Control](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/how-to-display-unbound-controls-in-a-datarepeater-control-visual-studio.md).  
  
 You can also bind to a data source at run time by setting the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.VirtualMode%2A> property to `True` and assigning a data source to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DataSource%2A> property. In this case, you will need to manage all interaction with the data source. For more information, see [Virtual Mode in the DataRepeater Control](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/virtual-mode-in-the-datarepeater-control-visual-studio.md).

### To create a data-bound DataRepeater  
  
1.  Drag a <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater> control from the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab in the **Toolbox** to a form or container control.  
  
2.  Drag the sizing and position handles to size and position the control.  
  
     Note that the control has two rectangular regions. The upper region is the *item template*; controls added to the template will be repeated in each item in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater> control at run time. The lower region is the *viewport*, where the items will be displayed.  
  
     You can also size and position the control or the item template by changing the **Size** and **Position** properties in the Properties window.  
  
3.  On the **Data** menu, click **Show Data Sources**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the **Data Sources** window is empty, add a data source to it. For more information, see [Add new data sources](/visualstudio/data-tools/add-new-data-sources).  
  
4.  In the **Data Sources** window, select the top-level node for the table that contains the data that you want to bind.  
  
5.  Change the drop type of the table to `Details` by clicking `Details` in the drop-down list on the table node.  
  
6.  Select the table node and drag it onto the item template region of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater> control.  
  
     You can specify which types of controls are displayed for each field. For more information, see [Set the control to be created when dragging from the Data Sources window](/visualstudio/data-tools/set-the-control-to-be-created-when-dragging-from-the-data-sources-window).
