# How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form (Visual Basic)
The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form exactly as it appears on screen without using a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component. The following procedure shows how to print a form, including both the client area and the non-client area. The non-client area includes the title bar, borders, and scroll bars.  
  
 The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  
  
### To print both the client and the non-client areas of a form  
  
1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  
  
     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray.  
  
2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction.PrintToPrinter>.  
  
3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a Print `Button`).  
  
    ```  
    PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.FullWindow)  
    ```  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  On some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly. In this case, use the compatible printing method: `PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.CompatibleModeFullWindow`).
