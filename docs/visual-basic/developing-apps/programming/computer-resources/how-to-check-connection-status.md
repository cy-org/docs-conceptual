# How to: Check Connection Status in Visual Basic
The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Network.IsAvailable%2A> property can be used to determine whether the computer has a working network or Internet connection.  
  
[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](~/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
### To check whether a computer has a working connection  
  
-   Determine whether the `IsAvailable` property is `True` or `False`. The following code checks the property's status and reports it:  
  
     [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#3](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-check-connection-status_1.vb)]  
  
     This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Connectivity and Networking**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).
