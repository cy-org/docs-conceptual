# Accessing computer resources (Visual Basic)

The `My.Computer` object is one of the three central objects in `My`, providing access to information and commonly used functionality. `My.Computer` provides methods, properties, and events for accessing the computer on which the application is running. Its objects include:  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio>
-   Clipboard (<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.ClipboardProxy>)
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Clock>
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem>
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.ServerComputer.Info%2A>
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Keyboard>
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Mouse>
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Network>
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports>
-   Registry (<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.RegistryProxy>)
