# How to: Send Strings to Serial Ports in Visual Basic
This topic describes how to use `My.Computer.Ports` to send strings to the computer's serial ports in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)].  
  
## Example  
 This example sends a string to the COM1 serial port. You may need to use a different serial port on your computer.  
  
 Use the `My.Computer.Ports.OpenSerialPort` method to obtain a reference to the port. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports.OpenSerialPort%2A>.  
  
 The `Using` block allows the application to close the serial port even if it generates an exception. All code that manipulates the serial port should appear within this block or within a `Try...Catch...Finally` block.  
  
 The <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.WriteLine%2A> method sends the data to the serial port.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#33](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-send-strings-to-serial-ports_1.vb)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
  
-   This example assumes the computer is using `COM1`.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 This example assumes the computer is using `COM1`; for more flexibility, the code should allow the user to select the desired serial port from a list of available ports. For more information, see [How to: Show Available Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-show-available-serial-ports.md).  
  
 This example uses a `Using` block to make sure that the application closes the port even if it throws an exception. For more information, see [Using Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md).
