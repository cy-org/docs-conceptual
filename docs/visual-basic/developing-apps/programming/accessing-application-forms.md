# Accessing Application Forms (Visual Basic)
The `My.Forms` object provides an easy way to access an instance of each Windows Form declared in the application's project. You can also use properties of the `My.Application` object to access the application's splash screen and main form, and get a list of the application's open forms.  
  
## Tasks  
 The following table lists examples showing how to access an application's forms.
