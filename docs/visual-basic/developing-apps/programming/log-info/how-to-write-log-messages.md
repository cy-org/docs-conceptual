# How to: Write Log Messages (Visual Basic)
You can use the `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` objects to log information about your application. This example shows how to use the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to log tracing information.  
  
 For logging exception information, use the `My.Application.Log.WriteException` method; see [How to: Log Exceptions](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/how-to-log-exceptions.md).  
  
## Example  
 This example uses the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to write out the trace information.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyApplicationLog#11](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-write-log-messages_1.vb)]  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 Make sure the data you write to the log does not include sensitive information such as user passwords. For more information, see [Working with Application Logs](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/working-with-application-logs.md).
