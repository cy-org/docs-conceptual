# How to: Rename a File in Visual Basic
Use the `RenameFile` method of the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to rename a file by supplying the current location, file name, and the new file name. This method cannot be used to move a file; use the `MoveFile` method to move and rename the file.  
  
### To rename a file  
  
-   Use the `My.Computer.FileSystem.RenameFile` method to rename a file. This example renames the file named `Test.txt` to `SecondTest.txt`.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#9](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-rename-a-file_1.vb)]  
  
 This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, the snippet is located in **File system - Processing Drives, Folders, and Files**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\.\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
-   `newName` contains path information (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
-   `newName` is `Nothing` or an empty string (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
-   The source file is not valid or does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>).  
  
-   There is an existing file or directory with the name specified in `newName` (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
-   A file or directory name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  
  
-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
-   The user does not have the required permission (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).
