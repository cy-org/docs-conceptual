# How to: Write to Binary Files in Visual Basic
The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes%2A> method writes data to a binary file. If the `append` parameter is `True`, it will append the data to the file; otherwise data in the file is overwritten.  
  
 If the specified path excluding the file name is not valid, a <xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException> exception will be thrown. If the path is valid but the file does not exist, the file will be created.  
  
### To write to a binary file  
  
-   Use the `WriteAllBytes` method, supplying the file path and name and the bytes to be written. This example appends the data array `CustomerData` to the file named `CollectedData.dat`.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#27](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-write-to-binary-files_1.vb)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may create an exception:  
  
-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string; it contains only white space; or it contains invalid characters. (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
-   `File` points to a path that does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException> or <xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException>).  
  
-   The file is in use by another process, or an I/O error occurs (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
-   A file or directory name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  
  
-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).
