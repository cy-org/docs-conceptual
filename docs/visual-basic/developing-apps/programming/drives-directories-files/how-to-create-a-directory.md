# How to: Create a Directory in Visual Basic
Use the `CreateDirectory` method of the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to create directories.  
  
 If the directory already exists, no exception is thrown.  
  
### To create a directory  
  
-   Use the `CreateDirectory` method by specifying the full path of the location where the directory should be created. This example creates the directory `NewDirectory` in `C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents`.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#2](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-create-a-directory_1.vb)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   The directory name is malformed. For example, it contains illegal characters or is only white space (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
-   The parent directory of the directory to be created is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
-   The directory name is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
-   The directory name is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
-   The directory name is a colon ":" (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  
  
-   The user does not have permission to create the directory (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  
  
-   The user lacks permissions in a partial-trust situation (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).
