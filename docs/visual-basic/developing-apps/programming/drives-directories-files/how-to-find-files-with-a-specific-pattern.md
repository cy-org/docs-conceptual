# How to: Find Files with a Specific Pattern in Visual Basic
The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.FileSystemProxy.GetFiles%2A> method returns a read-only collection of strings representing the path names for the files. You can use the `wildCards` parameter to specify a specific pattern. If you would like to include subdirectories in the search, set the `searchType` parameter to `SearchOption.SearchAllSubDirectories`.  
  
 An empty collection is returned if no files matching the specified pattern are found.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For information about returning a file list by using the `DirectoryInfo` class of the `System.IO` namespace, see <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A>.  
  
### To find files with a specified pattern  
  
-   Use the `GetFiles` method, supplying the name and path of the directory you want to search and specifying the pattern. The following example returns all files with the extension `.dll` in the directory and adds them to `ListBox1`.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbFileIOMisc#4](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-find-files-with-a-specific-pattern_1.vb)]  
  
## .NET Framework Security  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\.\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
-   `directory` does not exist (<xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException>).  
  
-   `directory` points to an existing file (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
-   A file or folder name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  
  
-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
-   The user lacks necessary permissions (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).
