# Processing Drives, Directories, and Files (Visual Basic)
You can use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] to process drives, folders, and files with the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object, which provides better performance and is easier to use than traditional methods such as the `FileOpen` and `Write` functions (although they are still available). The following sections discuss these methods in detail.  
  
## In This Section  
 [File Access with Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/file-access.md)  
 Discusses how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to work with files, drives, and folders.  
  
 [Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/basics-of-net-framework-file-io-and-the-file-system.md)  
 Provides an overview of file I/O concepts in the .NET Framework, including streams, isolated storage, file events, file attributes, and file access.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files by Using .NET Framework Methods](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-by-using-net-framework-methods.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] to manipulate files and folders.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files and Directories in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to manipulate files and folders.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/program-structure-and-code-conventions.md)  
 Provides guidelines for the physical structure and appearance of programs.  
  
 <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem>  
 Reference documentation for the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object and its members.
