# Rapid Application Development with My.Resources and My.Settings (Visual Basic)
The `My.Resources` object provides access to the application's resources and allows you to dynamically retrieve resources for your application.  
  
## Retrieving Resources  
 A number of resources such as audio files, icons, images, and strings can be retrieved through the `My.Resources` object. For example, you can access the application's culture-specific resource files. The following example sets the icon of the form to the icon named `Form1Icon` stored in the application's resource file.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnMy#7](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/codesnippet/VisualBasic/rapid-application-development-with-my-resources-and-my-settings_1.vb)]  
  
 The `My.Resources` object exposes only global resources. It does not provide access to resource files associated with forms. You must access the form resources from the form. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5).  
  
 Similarly, the `My.Settings` object provides access to the application's settings and allows you to dynamically store and retrieve property settings and other information for your application. For more information, see [My.Resources Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-resources-object.md) and [My.Settings Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).
