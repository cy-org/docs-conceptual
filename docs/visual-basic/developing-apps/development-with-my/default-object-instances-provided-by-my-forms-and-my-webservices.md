# Default Object Instances Provided by My.Forms and My.WebServices (Visual Basic)
The [My.Forms](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-forms-object.md) and [My.WebServices](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md) objects provide access to forms, data sources, and XML Web services used by your application. They do this by providing collections of *default instances* of each of these objects.  
  
## Default Instances  
 A default instance is an instance of the class that is provided by the runtime and does not need to be declared and instantiated using the `Dim` and `New` statements. The following example demonstrates how you might have declared and instantiated an instance of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class called `Form1`, and how you are now able to get a default instance of this <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class through `My.Forms`.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnMy#5](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/codesnippet/VisualBasic/default-object-instances-provided-by-my-forms-and-my-webservices_1.vb)]  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnMy#6](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/codesnippet/VisualBasic/default-object-instances-provided-by-my-forms-and-my-webservices_2.vb)]  
  
 The `My.Forms` object returns a collection of default instances for every `Form` class that exists in your project. Similarly, `My.WebServices` provides a default instance of the proxy class for every Web service that you have created a reference to in your application.
