# Visual Basic Language Specification
The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] Language Specification is the authoritative source for answers to all questions about [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] grammar and syntax. It contains detailed information about the language, including many points not covered in the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] reference documentation.  
  
 The specification is available on the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=188623).  
  
This site contains the [VB 11 specification](../../../../_vblang/spec/introduction.md). It's built from the Markdown files contained in [the dotnet/vblang GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/blob/master/spec/README.md).

Issues on the specification should be created in the [dotnet/vblang](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/issues) repository. Or, if you're interested
in fixing any errors you find, you may submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/pulls) to the same repository.
