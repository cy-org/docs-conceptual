# Sample Compilation Command Lines (Visual Basic)
As an alternative to compiling [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] programs from within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](~/includes/vsprvs-md.md)], you can compile from the command line to produce executable (.exe) files or dynamic-link library (.dll) files.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] command-line compiler supports a complete set of options that control input and output files, assemblies, and debug and preprocessor options. Each option is available in two interchangeable forms: `-``option` and `/``option`. This documentation shows only the `/``option` form.  
  
 The following table lists some sample command lines you can modify for your own use.  
  
|To|Use|  
|--------|---------|  
|Compile File.vb and create File.exe|`vbc /reference:Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll File.vb`|  
|Compile File.vb and create File.dll|`vbc /target:library File.vb`|  
|Compile File.vb and create My.exe|`vbc /out:My.exe File.vb`|  
|Compile all [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] files in the current directory, with optimizations on and the `DEBUG` symbol defined, producing File2.exe|`vbc /define:DEBUG=1 /optimize /out:File2.exe *.vb`|  
|Compile all [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] files in the current directory, producing a debug version of File2.dll without displaying the logo or warnings|`vbc /target:library /out:File2.dll /nowarn /nologo /debug *.vb`|  
|Compile all [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] files in the current directory to Something.dll|`vbc /target:library /out:Something.dll *.vb`|  
  
 When compiling from the command line, you must explicitly reference the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] run-time library through the `/reference` compiler option.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  When you build a project by using the Visual Studio IDE, you can display information about the associated **vbc** command with its compiler options in the output window. To display this information, open the [Options Dialog Box,  Projects and Solutions, Build and Run](/visualstudio/ide/reference/options-dialog-box-projects-and-solutions-build-and-run), and then set the **MSBuild project build output verbosity** to **Normal** or a higher level of verbosity. For more information, see [How to: View, Save, and Configure Build Log Files](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/75d38b76-26d6-4f43-bbe7-cbacd7cc81e7).
