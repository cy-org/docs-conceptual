# /highentropyva (Visual Basic)
Indicates whether a 64-bit executable or an executable that's marked by the [/platform:anycpu](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/platform.md) compiler option supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/highentropyva[+ | -]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `+` &#124; `-`  
 Optional. The option is off by default or if you specify `/highentropyva-`. The option is on if you specify `/highentropyva` or `/highentropyva+`.  
  
## Remarks  
 If you specify this option, compatible versions of the Windows kernel can use higher degrees of entropy when the kernel randomizes the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR. If the kernel uses higher degrees of entropy, a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps. As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.  
  
 When the option is on, the target executable and any modules on which it depends must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when those modules are running as 64-bit processes.
