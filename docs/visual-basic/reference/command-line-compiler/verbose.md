# /verbose
Causes the compiler to produce verbose status and error messages.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/verbose[+ | -]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 `+` &#124; `-`  
 Optional. Specifying `/verbose` is the same as specifying `/verbose+`, which causes the compiler to emit verbose messages. The default for this option is `/verbose-`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `/verbose` option displays information about the total number of errors issued by the compiler, reports which assemblies are being loaded by a module, and displays which files are currently being compiled.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `/verbose` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  
  
## Example  
 The following code compiles `In.vb` and directs the compiler to display verbose status information.  
  
```  
vbc /verbose in.vb  
```
