# Unable to include XML fragment &#39;&lt;elementpath&gt;&#39; of file &#39;&lt;commentfile&gt;&#39;
An `<include>` tag in an XML comment contains an XPath expression for an element that does not exist, or the file contains badly formed XML.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42320  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the XML in the file is valid.  
  
2.  Verify that the XML fragment exists in the file.  
  
## See Also
