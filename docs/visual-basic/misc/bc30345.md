# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; cannot overload each other because they differ only by parameters declared &#39;ByRef&#39; or &#39;ByVal&#39;
You have attempted to overload a method with another method that differs from the first only by a parameter declared as `ByRef` or `ByVal`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30345  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than the name of the `ByRef` or `ByVal` parameter.
