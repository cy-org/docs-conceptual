# Value of type &#39;&lt;type1&gt;&#39; cannot be converted to &#39;&lt;type2&gt;&#39;
A statement attempts to convert one data type to another in a way that is not defined. Possible causes of this error include the following:  
  
-   A conversion specifies two data types between which no conversion exists. An example of this is a conversion from a `Boolean` value to the `Date` type.  
  
-   An initialization of an array does not include braces (`{}`) following a `New` clause. In this case, \<type2> is of the form '1-dimensional array of \<type>'.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30311  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the expression can be converted to the destination data type.  
  
-   If \<type2> is an array, make sure the `New` clause contains both parentheses and braces following the type name. The following code illustrates correct initialization of an array.  
  
    ```  
    Dim anIntArray As Integer() = New Integer() {}  
    ```
