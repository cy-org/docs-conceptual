# Operands of type Object used for operator &#39;&lt;operatorsymbol&gt;&#39;; runtime errors could occur
An expression uses an operator for which one or both operands are of the [Object Data Type](../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md).  
  
 When a variable or expression evaluates to `Object`, the compiler must perform *late binding*, which causes extra operations at run time. It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, suppose you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to an `Object` variable and then try to use it with the [/ Operator (Visual Basic)](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/floating-point-division-operator.md). If you do this, the runtime throws an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> because Visual Basic cannot convert a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object to a numeric value.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42019  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If possible, arrange the operands to evaluate to data types for which the operator is defined.
