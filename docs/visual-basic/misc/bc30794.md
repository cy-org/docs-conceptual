# No accessible &#39;&lt;procedurename&gt;&#39; is most specific: &lt;signaturelist&gt;
An assignment statement assigns the address of an overloaded procedure to a delegate variable, but the compiler cannot resolve among the overloaded versions.  
  
 When code uses the address of a procedure that is defined in several overloaded versions, the compiler must decide which of the overloads to use. It tries to find a single version with a parameter list that matches the delegate parameter list. For more information, see [Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md).  
  
 If the compiler finds more than one version of the procedure with a matching signature, it generates this error. This can happen, for example, if one of the overloads is generic and a type argument is passed to it that gives it a signature identical to that of another overload.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30794  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If the conflict is caused by a generic overload having the same signature as another overload, change the type argument passed to that generic overload.
