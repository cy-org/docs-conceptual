# You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the &#39;Equals&#39; operator
You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator. Range variable(s) \<variable(s)> must appear on one side of the 'Equals' operator, and range variable(s) \<variable(s)> must appear on the other.  
  
 Range variables identified for collections to be joined in a LINQ query must be on opposite sides of the `Equals` operator, depending on the collection they are identified for. That is, range variables identified for one of the collections being joined must be on the opposite side of the `Equals` operator from range variables for the other collection being joined. Range variables from separate collections cannot be mixed on the same side of the `Equals` operator.  
  
 At least one variable from each collection being joined must be referenced on each side of the `Equals` operator.
