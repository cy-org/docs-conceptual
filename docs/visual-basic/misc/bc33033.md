# Matching &#39;&lt;operatorsymbol1&gt;&#39; operator is required for &#39;&lt;operatorsymbol2&gt;&#39;
An operator is defined when its required matching operator is not defined.  
  
 The following operators must be defined as matched pairs:  
  
-   `=` and `<>`  
  
-   `>` and `<`  
  
-   `>=` and `<=`  
  
-   `IsTrue` and `IsFalse`  
  
 If you define any of these operators in a class or structure, you must also define its matching operator in the same class or structure.  
  
 Even if you do not use the matching operator explicitly, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] might need to use it. For example, if you define a class or structure that you use as the counter variable in a [For...Next Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md), [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] requires both the `>=` and `<=` operators (as well as the `+` operator).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33033  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Define the matching operator in the same class or structure. Make every effort to define it meaningfully, because [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] might use it in a situation you do not anticipate.
