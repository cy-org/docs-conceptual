# Interface &#39;&lt;interfacename&gt;&#39; cannot be indexed because it has no default property
Index expressions must result in a value whose type is an array, in a value whose type has a set of overloaded default properties, or in a set of overloaded properties. An interface can have only one default method or property. This means that it can either inherit an interface containing a default method or property, or its definition block can contain one method or property that is marked as default.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30547  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Supply a default property in the interface.  
  
## See Also  
 [Interface Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/interface-statement.md)
