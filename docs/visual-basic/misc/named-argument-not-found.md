# Named argument not found (Visual Basic)
A named argument can not be used in a procedure invocation unless it appears in the procedure definition. You specified a named argument, but the procedure was not defined to accept an argument by that name.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the spelling of the argument name.
