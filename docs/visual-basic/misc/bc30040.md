# First statement of a method body cannot be on the same line as the method declaration
A `Function`, `Sub`, `Get`, `Set`, or `Property` statement must be alone on a source code line.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30040  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove any line label preceding the procedure declaration.  
  
2.  Move any statement preceding the procedure declaration to a previous source code line.  
  
3.  Move any statement following the procedure declaration to a subsequent source code line.
