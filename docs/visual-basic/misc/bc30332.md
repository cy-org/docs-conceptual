# Value of type &#39;&lt;type1&gt;&#39; cannot be converted to &#39;&lt;type2&gt;&#39; because &#39;&lt;type3&gt;&#39; is not derived from &#39;&lt;type4&gt;&#39;
A statement attempts to convert an array type to another array type in a situation where the data types of the elements of the arrays are not both reference types, or where a conversion, either widening or narrowing, is not possible between the element types of the two arrays.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30332  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the data types of the elements of both arrays to determine the source of the error.
