# Conversion operators cannot convert from Object
A conversion operator is declared with a parameter of the [Object Data Type](../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md).  
  
 At compile time, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] considers a predefined conversion to exist from any reference type to any type in its inheritance hierarchy, that is, any type from which it derives or which derives from it. `Object` is the universal data type in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], so every type derives from `Object`.  
  
 Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33032  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.
