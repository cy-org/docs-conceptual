# &#39;ReadOnly&#39; properties cannot have an access modifier on &#39;Get&#39;
A `ReadOnly` property declaration specifies access levels in both the [Property Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md) and the [Get Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/get-statement.md).  
  
 You can always specify an access level for the property. In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level. You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31105  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the access modifier from the `Get` statement. It represents the entire `ReadOnly` property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property.
