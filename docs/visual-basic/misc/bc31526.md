# &#39;System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute&#39; cannot be applied to a method that is generic or nested in a generic type
A procedure is declared with the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute>, but either the procedure is generic or it is contained in a generic class or structure.  
  
 The common language runtime (CLR) recognizes this attribute and its <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices._Assembly.EntryPoint%2A> property as designating a replacement procedure defined in an unmanaged dynamic-link library (DLL) outside the .NET Framework. When code calls the procedure to which the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute> is applied, the common language runtime calls the designated unmanaged procedure instead.  
  
 Because unmanaged platforms outside the .NET Framework do not recognize generic types, you cannot interoperate with them using generic types.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31526  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If neither the procedure nor its container needs to be generic, then remove the `Of` clauses so that they are not generic.  
  
-   If the procedure or its container needs to be generic, then remove the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute> from the declaration of this procedure.
