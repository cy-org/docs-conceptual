# At least one parameter type of this binary operator must be the containing type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
A definition of a binary operator specifies both parameters with types other than that of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.  
  
 When you define an operator in a class or structure, at least one of the parameters must be of the type of that class or structure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33021  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the type of one or both of the parameters to the type of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.
