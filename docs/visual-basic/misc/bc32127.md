# &#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type
A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32127  
  
## To correct this error
  
1.  To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.  
  
```vb  
Dim number? As Integer = 5  

If number IsNot Nothing Then  
  If number.GetType() Is Type.GetType("System.Int32") Then   

  End If  
End If  
```
