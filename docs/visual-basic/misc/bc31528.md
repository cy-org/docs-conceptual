# Construct makes an indirect reference to assembly &#39;&lt;assemblyname&gt;&#39;, which contains &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
Construct makes an indirect reference to assembly '\<assemblyname>', which contains \<typename>. Add a file reference to \<filename> to your project.  
  
 An expression uses a type, such as a class, structure, interface, enumeration, or delegate, but your assembly does not have a project reference to the assembly that defines the type.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31528  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   In your project properties, add a reference to the file that contains the assembly that defines the type you are using.
