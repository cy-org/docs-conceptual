# &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is an Enum type and cannot be used as an expression
A type name occurs where an expression is required. An expression must consist of a combination of variables, constants, literals, properties, and `Function` procedure calls.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30107  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the type name and construct the expression using valid elements.
