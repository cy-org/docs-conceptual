# &#39;NonSerialized&#39; attribute will not affect this member because its containing class is not exposed as &#39;Serializable&#39;
By default, classes and their members are non-serializable. The <xref:System.NonSerializedAttribute> attribute is only needed if a member of a serializable class should not be serialized.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30772  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> attribute to the class.  
  
     —or—  
  
-   Remove the <xref:System.NonSerializedAttribute> attribute from the member.
