# Event &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; implicitly declares &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39;, which conflicts with a member in the base &lt;type&gt; &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39;, and so the event should be declared &#39;Shadows&#39;
An event is declared with a name that combines to form an implicit member with the same name as a member of the base class. For example, if you declare an event named `Event1`, the compiler generates the implicit procedures `add_Event1` and `remove_Event1`. If the base class has a member with one of these names, the event in this class should shadow the base class member.  
  
 This message is a warning. `Shadows` is assumed by default. For more information about hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40012  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  To hide the base class member, add the `Shadows` keyword to the event declaration.  
  
2.  If you do not intend to hide the base class member, change the name of the event.
