# Statement does not declare a &#39;Get&#39; or &#39;Set&#39; method
Your statement fails to supply either a `Get` or `Set` declaration statement around a `Property` procedure. A property is defined as a block of code enclosed within the `Property` and `End Property` statements. Inside this block, each `Property` procedure appears as an internal block enclosed within a declaration statement and an end statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30576  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Supply a `Get` or `Set` declaration statement.
