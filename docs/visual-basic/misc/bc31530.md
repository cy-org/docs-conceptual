# &#39;System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute&#39; cannot be applied to interface methods
A procedure is defined inside an interface, but the procedure definition applies the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute>.  
  
 The common language runtime (CLR) recognizes this attribute and its <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices._Assembly.EntryPoint%2A> property as designating a replacement procedure defined in an unmanaged dynamic-link library (DLL) outside the .NET Framework. When code calls the procedure to which the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute> is applied, the common language runtime calls the designated unmanaged procedure instead.  
  
 Because the definition of a procedure inside an interface does not include any implementation, it cannot interoperate with unmanaged platforms outside the .NET Framework.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31530  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImportAttribute> from the definition of this procedure.
