# &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; is not declared or the module containing it is not loaded in the debugging session
The specified member could not be found.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30699  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Verify that the member is defined and spelled correctly.  
  
2.  Access one of the members declared in the module. In some cases, the debugging environment cannot locate members because the modules where they are declared have not yet been loaded.
