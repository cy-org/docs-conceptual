# Option Strict On does not allow narrowing in implicit type conversions between method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; and delegate &#39;&lt;delegatename&gt;&#39;
With `Option Strict` on, you cannot have a narrowing conversion between the data type of a parameter in a delegate and the corresponding parameter of a function or `Sub` assigned to a variable of that delegate type. For example, function delegate `Del` has one parameter of type `Integer`, and functions `Conversion1`, `Conversion2`, and `Conversion3` have one parameter of different numeric types.  
  
```vb  
Delegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer) As String  
  
Function Conversion1(ByVal n As Integer) As String  
    Return "Valid"  
End Function  
  
Function Conversion2(ByVal n As Long) As String  
    Return "Valid"  
End Function  
  
Function Conversion3(ByVal n As Short) As String  
    Return "Not valid"  
End Function  
```  
  
 Because there is a widening conversion from `Integer` to `Integer` and to `Long`, the following assignments are valid.  
  
```vb  
' Valid.  
Dim funDel1 As Del = AddressOf Conversion1  
Dim funDel2 As Del = AddressOf Conversion2  
```  
  
 The conversion from `Integer` to `Short` is a narrowing conversion. Therefore, the following assignment is not valid.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
Dim funDel3 As Del = AddressOf Conversion3  
```  
  
 Error ID: BC36663  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the data type of the parameter in the delegate or the method so that the required widening relationship exists.
