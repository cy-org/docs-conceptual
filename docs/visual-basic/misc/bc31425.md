# &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; in assembly &#39;&lt;assemblyname&gt;&#39; has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type
An assembly uses the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeForwardedToAttribute> to forward one of its types to another assembly, but specifies the same type in the same assembly.  
  
 *Type forwarding* means reassigning the definition of a class, structure, interface, delegate, or enumeration to an assembly other than the one in which it was originally defined. It is often used in conjunction with *code refactoring*, by which you split an assembly into two or more assemblies or move code from one assembly to another.  
  
 Forwarding a type to itself results in circular forwarding. If another assembly attempted to access the forwarded type, it would go through endless forwarding without ever arriving at a type that had not been forwarded.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31425  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Forward the type to a type in a different assembly, or do not forward it at all.
