# &#39;And&#39; expected
A comparison operator other than `And` has been used to combine two or more `Equals` operators in a `Join` or `Group Join` clause. Only the `And` operator is allowed to combine multiple `Equals` operators in a `Join` or `Group Join` clause.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36620  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Restructure the `Equals` clauses to make comparisons by using only the `And` operator. The following is an example:  
  
```vb  
Dim petOwnersJoin = From pers In people _  
                    Join pet In pets _  
                    On pet.Owner Equals pers And _  
                       pet.Name = pers.PetName_  
                    Select pers, pet  
```
