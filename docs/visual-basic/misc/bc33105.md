# &#39;If&#39; operands cannot be named arguments
Using named arguments in the operands of the `If` operator is not valid. The following example causes this error:  
  
```  
Dim i As Integer  
Dim result As String  
' Not valid.  
' result = (If(i > 0, TruePart:="positive", FalsePart:="not positive")  
```  
  
 This differs from the `IIf` function, which does allow named arguments, as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
' Valid.  
IIf(i > 0, TruePart:="positive", FalsePart:="not positive")  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33105  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the name assignments from the operands, as shown in the following code.  
  
    ```  
    result = If(i > 0, "positive", "not positive")  
    ```
