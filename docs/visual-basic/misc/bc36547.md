# Anonymous type member or property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; is already declared
A property name can be established only once in the declaration of an anonymous type. For example, the following declarations are not valid:  
  
```vb  
'' Not valid, because the Label property is assigned to twice.  
' Dim anonType1 = New With {.Label = "Debra Garcia", .Label = .Label & ", President"}  
'' Not valid, because the property name inferred for both properties is  
'' Name.  
' Dim anonType2 = New With {Key product.Name, Key car1.Name}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36547  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Choose a different name for one of the properties.  
  
```vb  
' Valid.  
Dim anonType3 = New With {.Name = "Debra Garcia", .Label = .Name & ", President"}  
```  
  
-   Provide new names for the variables or property names from which you are inferring names and values.  
  
```vb  
' Valid.  
Dim anonType4 = New With {Key .ProductName = product.Name, Key .CarName = car1.Name}  
```
