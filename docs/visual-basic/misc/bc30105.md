# Number of indices is less than the number of dimensions of the indexed array
The number of indices used to access an array element must be exactly the same as the rank of the array, that is, the number of dimensions declared for it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30105  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Add subscripts to the array reference until the total number of subscripts equals the rank of the array.
