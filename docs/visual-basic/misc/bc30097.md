# &#39;Exit While&#39; can only appear inside a &#39;While&#39; statement
An `Exit While` statement occurs outside a `While` block. `Exit While` is valid only between a `While` statement and a corresponding `End While` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30097  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure a valid `While` statement precedes the `Exit While` and a valid `End While` statement appears after it.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `While` block are correctly terminated.
