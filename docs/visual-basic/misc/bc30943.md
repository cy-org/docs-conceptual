# Generic methods cannot be exposed to COM
A [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] component containing one or more generic procedures is exported to a COM component.  
  
 The Component Object Model (COM) does not support generic types, and it cannot interoperate with them.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30943  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove the generic procedure or procedures from the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] component, or do not use it for COM interop.  
  
## See Also  
 [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)   
 [COM Interop](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/index.md)
