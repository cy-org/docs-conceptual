# Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type
A conversion operator is declared with an interface type as a return type.  
  
 At compile time, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] considers a predefined conversion to exist from any reference type to any interface. Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.  
  
 Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC33025  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.
