# Type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; and partial type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; conflict in container &#39;&lt;containername&gt;&#39;, but are being merged because one of them is declared partial
A class or structure is appears in multiple definitions in the same container type, and more than one definition is not marked `Partial`.  
  
 You must use the [Partial](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/partial.md) keyword on at least one of the multiple definitions of a class or structure, but it is recommended that you use it on all the partial definitions.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40046  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use the [Partial](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/partial.md) keyword on every partial definition of the class or structure.
