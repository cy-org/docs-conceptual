# Generic methods cannot use &#39;Handles&#39; clause
A generic `Sub` procedure includes a [Handles](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/handles-clause.md) clause in its declaration.  
  
 A `Handles` clause specifies a list of events that the `Sub` procedure handles. To be an event handler, the `Sub` procedure must have the same signature as each event it is to handle. A generic procedure can be created more than once, with signatures that [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] cannot predict at compile time. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] cannot guarantee a signature that matches those of the events in the `Handles` clause.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32080  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If the `Sub` procedure needs to be generic, remove the `Handles` clause from its declaration. Use the [AddHandler Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/addhandler-statement.md) to associate this event handler with an event.  
  
-   If the `Sub` procedure needs to use the `Handles` clause to associate events, remove the [Of](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/of-clause.md) clause from its declaration. You must use a nongeneric procedure with `Handles`.
