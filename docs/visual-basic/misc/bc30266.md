# &#39;&lt;declaration1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;declaration2&gt;&#39; because they have different access levels
A procedure or property declaration attempts to override an inherited element of the same name, but it specifies a different accessibility than the inherited element. The inherited element's accessibility, such as `Public` or `Private`, must be preserved in overriding.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30266  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the accessibility of the overriding element to match that of the inherited element.
