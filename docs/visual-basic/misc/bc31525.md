# Type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; is imported from different versions of assembly &#39;&lt;assemblyname&gt;&#39;
Type '\<typename>' is imported from different versions of assembly '\<assemblyname>'. Different versions of the same assembly cannot be used in the same project.  
  
 A type was imported from different versions of the same assembly, creating ambiguity.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31525  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Remove references to multiple versions of the same assembly.
