# Identifier expected, preceded with a period
A value from which a property name cannot be inferred has been included in the initializer list of an anonymous type declaration without being assigned to a property name.  
  
```  
' Not valid.  
' Dim anon1 = New With {.grade = 100, 95}  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36576  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Provide a property name for each value in the initializer list, as shown in the following code:  
  
    ```  
    Dim anon2 = New With {.grade1 = 100, .grade2 = 95}  
    ```
