# &#39;Group&#39; or an identifier expected
The `Into` portion of a `Group By` or `Group Join` clause does not include the `Group` keyword. You must include the `Group` keyword in the `Into` clause of a `Group By` or `Group Join` clause to identify the variable name to use for the grouped results. This can be either a name you specify or the keyword `Group`.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36707  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the `Into` portion of the `Group By` or `Group Join` clause includes the `Group` keyword, as shown in the following example.  
  
```vb  
Dim orders = From order In orderList _  
             Order By order.OrderDate _  
             Group By OrderDate = order.OrderDate _  
             Into OrdersByDate = Group  
```
