# &#39;End With&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;With&#39;
An `End With` statement occurs without a corresponding `With` statement. `End With` must be preceded by a corresponding `With` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30093  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If this `With` block is part of a set of nested `With` blocks, make sure each block is properly terminated.  
  
2.  Verify that other control structures within the `With` block are correctly terminated.  
  
3.  Ensure that this `With` block is correctly formatted.
