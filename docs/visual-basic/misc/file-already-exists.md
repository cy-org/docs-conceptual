# File already exists
This error occurs as a result of either naming a new file with the name of an existing file or using the **Save As** command to save a currently loaded project with a name that already exists.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the name and either change it to one that does not conflict, or delete the pre-existing file or project if it is no longer needed.
