# Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared
Object initializers cannot be used to initialize any member of a class that is declared as shared. For more information, see [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30991  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Examine the class definition to determine which member is shared.  
  
2.  Eliminate the initialization for that member from the object initializer list.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, `totalCustomers` is a shared member.  
  
```  
Public Class Customer  
    Public Shared totalCustomers As Integer  
    ' Other declarations and method definitions.  
End Class  
```  
  
 Because `totalCustomers` is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error.  
  
```  
' This declaration is not valid.  
' Dim cust As New Customer With { .Name = "Coho Winery", _  
'                                 .totalCustomers = 21 }  
```
