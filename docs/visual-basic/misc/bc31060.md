# &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; implicitly defines &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39;, which conflicts with a member of the same name in &lt;type&gt; &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for a property. Properties implicitly create several implicit variables that can conflict with defined members.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31060  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.
