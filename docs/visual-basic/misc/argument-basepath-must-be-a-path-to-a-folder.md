# Argument BasePath must be a path to a folder
The argument `BasePath` must consist of a path to a folder. You may be parsing a string incorrectly and supplying a value that is not recognized as a valid path.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check the value you are supplying for `BasePath` to make sure it is a valid path to a folder.
