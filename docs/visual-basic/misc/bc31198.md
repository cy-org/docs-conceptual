# XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses
An XML literal declaration is used in an expression in a location that is ambiguous to the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler. That is, the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler cannot determine whether the less-than character (<) is intended as a comparative operator or the start of an XML literal. The following code provides an example:  

```vb  
' Generates an error.  
Dim queryResult = From element In elements _  
                  Where <sample>Value</sample> = "Value" _  
                  Select element  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31198  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Enclose the XML literal declaration in parentheses, as shown in the following example:  
  
```vb  
Dim queryResult = From element In elements _  
                  Where (<sample> Value</sample>) = "Value" _  
                  Select element  
```  
  
-   Modify your code to refer to an existing XML literal, as shown in the following example:  
  
```vb  
Dim queryResult = From element In elements _  
                  Where e.<sample>.Value = "Value" _  
                  Select element  
```
