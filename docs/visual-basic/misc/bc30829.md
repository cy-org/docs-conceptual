# &#39;Get&#39; statements are no longer supported
`Get` statements are no longer supported. File I/O functionality is available in the `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespace.  
  
 `Get` is not supported for file operations, and can only be used in property procedure syntax.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30829  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Perform file operations using the members of `System.IO`, `FileSystemObject`, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] run-time functions.
