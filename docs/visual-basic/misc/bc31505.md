# &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; cannot be used as an attribute because it does not have a &#39;System.AttributeUsageAttribute&#39; attribute
An attempt was made to use an attribute that was declared without the `System.AttributeUsageAttribute` to define its usage.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31505  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Custom attributes must be classes derived from `System.Attribute` that have the `AttributeUsageAttribute` attribute applied.  
  
## See Also  
 <xref:System.AttributeUsageAttribute>
