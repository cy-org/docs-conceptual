# &#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; and &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; cannot overload each other because they differ only by parameters declared &#39;ParamArray&#39;
You have attempted to overload two methods that differ from each other only by a `ParamArray` parameter or parameters. The compiler considers a procedure with a `ParamArray` parameter to have an infinite number of overloads differing from each other in what is passed to the parameter array.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30368  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the methods are differentiated by more than the `ParamArray` parameters.
