# #Const Directive
Defines conditional compiler constants for Visual Basic.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
#Const constname = expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `constname`  
 Required. Name of the constant being defined.  
  
 `expression`  
 Required. Literal, other conditional compiler constant, or any combination that includes any or all arithmetic or logical operators except `Is`.  
  
## Remarks  
 Conditional compiler constants are always private to the file in which they appear. You cannot create public compiler constants using the `#Const` directive; you can create them only in the user interface or with the `/define` compiler option.  
  
 You can use only conditional compiler constants and literals in `expression`. Using a standard constant defined with `Const` causes an error. Conversely, you can use constants defined with the `#Const` keyword only for conditional compilation. Constants can also be undefined, in which case they have a value of `Nothing`.  
  
## Example  
 This example uses the `#Const` directive.
