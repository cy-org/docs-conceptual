# UShort data type (Visual Basic)

Holds unsigned 16-bit (2-byte) integers ranging in value from 0 through 65,535.  
  
## Remarks

 Use the `UShort` data type to contain binary data too large for `Byte`.  
  
 The default value of `UShort` is 0.  

# Literal assignments

You can declare and initialize a `UShort` variable by assigning it a decimal literal, a hexadecimal literal, an octal literal, or (starting with Visual Basic 2017) a binary literal. If the integer literal is outside the range of `UShort` (that is, if it is less than <xref:System.UInt16.MinValue?displayProperty=fullName> or greater than <xref:System.UInt16.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>, a compilation error occurs.

In the following example, integers equal to 65,034 that are represented as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary literals are assigned to `UShort` values.
  
[!code-vb[UShort](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#UShort)]

> [!NOTE]
> You use the prefix `&h` or `&H` to denote a hexadecimal literal, the prefix `&b` or `&B` to denote a binary literal, and the prefix `&o` or `&O` to denote an octal literal. Decimal literals have no prefix.

Starting with Visual Basic 2017, you can also use the underscore character, `_`, as a digit separator to enhance readability, as the following example shows.

[!code-vb[UShort](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#UShortS)]

Numeric literals can also include the `US` or `us` [type character](../../programming-guide\language-features\data-types/type-characters.md) to denote the `UShort` data type, as the following example shows.

```vb
Dim number = &H035826us
```

## Programming tips
  
-   **Negative Numbers.** Because `UShort` is an unsigned type, it cannot represent a negative number. If you use the unary minus (`-`) operator on an expression that evaluates to type `UShort`, Visual Basic converts the expression to `Integer` first.  
  
-   **CLS Compliance.** The `UShort` data type is not part of the [Common Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm) (CLS), so CLS-compliant code cannot consume a component that uses it.
  
-   **Widening.** The `UShort` data type widens to `Integer`, `UInteger`, `Long`, `ULong`, `Decimal`, `Single`, and `Double`. This means you can convert `UShort` to any of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=fullName> error.  
  
-   **Type Characters.** Appending the literal type characters `US` to a literal forces it to the `UShort` data type. `UShort` has no identifier type character.  
  
-   **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.UInt16?displayProperty=fullName> structure.
