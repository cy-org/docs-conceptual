# UInteger data type

Holds unsigned 32-bit (4-byte) integers ranging in value from 0 through 4,294,967,295.  
  
## Remarks

 The `UInteger` data type provides the largest unsigned value in the most efficient data width.  
  
 The default value of `UInteger` is 0.  
  
## Literal assignments

You can declare and initialize a `UInteger` variable by assigning it a decimal literal, a hexadecimal literal, an octal literal, or (starting with Visual Basic 2017) a binary literal. If the integer literal is outside the range of `UInteger` (that is, if it is less than <xref:System.UInt32.MinValue?displayProperty=fullName> or greater than <xref:System.UInt32.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName>, a compilation error occurs.

In the following example, integers equal to 3,000,000,000 that are represented as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary literals are assigned to `UInteger` values.
  
[!code-vb[UInteger](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#UInt)]  

> [!NOTE] 
> You use the prefix `&h` or `&H` to denote a hexadecimal literal, the prefix `&b` or `&B` to denote a binary literal, and the prefix `&o` or `&O` to denote an octal literal. Decimal literals have no prefix.

Starting with Visual Basic 2017, you can also use the underscore character, `_`, as a digit separator to enhance readability, as the following example shows.

[!code-vb[UInteger](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/data-types/numeric-literals.vb#UIntS)]  

Numeric literals can also include the `UI` or `ui` [type character](../../programming-guide\language-features\data-types/type-characters.md) to denote the `UInteger` data type, as the following example shows.

```vb
Dim number = &H0FAC14D7ui
```

## Programming tips

 The `UInteger` and `Integer` data types provide optimal performance on a 32-bit processor, because the smaller integer types (`UShort`, `Short`, `Byte`, and `SByte`), even though they use fewer bits, take more time to load, store, and fetch.  
  
-   **Negative Numbers.** Because `UInteger` is an unsigned type, it cannot represent a negative number. If you use the unary minus (`-`) operator on an expression that evaluates to type `UInteger`, Visual Basic converts the expression to `Long` first.  
  
-   **CLS Compliance.** The `UInteger` data type is not part of the [Common Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm) (CLS), so CLS-compliant code cannot consume a component that uses it.
  
-   **Interop Considerations.** If you are interfacing with components not written for the .NET Framework, for example Automation or COM objects, keep in mind that types such as `uint` can have a different data width (16 bits) in other environments. If you are passing a 16-bit argument to such a component, declare it as `UShort` instead of `UInteger` in your managed Visual Basic code.  
  
-   **Widening.** The `UInteger` data type widens to `Long`, `ULong`, `Decimal`, `Single`, and `Double`. This means you can convert `UInteger` to any of these types without encountering a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=fullName> error.  
  
-   **Type Characters.** Appending the literal type characters `UI` to a literal forces it to the `UInteger` data type. `UInteger` has no identifier type character.  
  
-   **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.UInt32?displayProperty=fullName> structure.
