# Char Data Type (Visual Basic)
Holds unsigned 16-bit (2-byte) code points ranging in value from 0 through 65535. Each *code point*, or character code, represents a single Unicode character.  
  
## Remarks  
 Use the `Char` data type when you need to hold only a single character and do not need the overhead of `String`. In some cases you can use `Char()`, an array of `Char` elements, to hold multiple characters.  
  
 The default value of `Char` is the character with a code point of 0.  
  
## Unicode Characters  
 The first 128 code points (0–127) of Unicode correspond to the letters and symbols on a standard U.S. keyboard. These first 128 code points are the same as those the ASCII character set defines. The second 128 code points (128–255) represent special characters, such as Latin-based alphabet letters, accents, currency symbols, and fractions. Unicode uses the remaining code points (256-65535) for a wide variety of symbols, including worldwide textual characters, diacritics, and mathematical and technical symbols.  
  
 You can use methods like <xref:System.Char.IsDigit%2A> and <xref:System.Char.IsPunctuation%2A> on a `Char` variable to determine its Unicode classification.  
  
## Type Conversions  
 Visual Basic does not convert directly between `Char` and the numeric types. You can use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.Asc%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.AscW%2A> function to convert a `Char` value to an `Integer` that represents its code point. You can use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.Chr%2A> or <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.ChrW%2A> function to convert an `Integer` value to a `Char` that has that code point.  
  
 If the type checking switch ([Option Strict Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-strict-statement.md)) is on, you must append the literal type character to a single-character string literal to identify it as the `Char` data type. The following example illustrates this.  
  
```  
Option Strict On  
Dim charVar As Char  
' The following statement attempts to convert a String literal to Char.  
' Because Option Strict is On, it generates a compiler error.  
charVar = "Z"  
' The following statement succeeds because it specifies a Char literal.  
charVar = "Z"C  
```  
  
## Programming Tips  
  
-   **Negative Numbers.** `Char` is an unsigned type and cannot represent a negative value. In any case, you should not use `Char` to hold numeric values.  
  
-   **Interop Considerations.** If you interface with components not written for the .NET Framework, for example Automation or COM objects, remember that character types have a different data width (8 bits) in other environments. If you pass an 8-bit argument to such a component, declare it as `Byte` instead of `Char` in your new Visual Basic code.  
  
-   **Widening.** The `Char` data type widens to `String`. This means you can convert `Char` to `String` and will not encounter a <xref:System.OverflowException?displayProperty=fullName> error.  
  
-   **Type Characters.** Appending the literal type character `C` to a single-character string literal forces it to the `Char` data type. `Char` has no identifier type character.  
  
-   **Framework Type.** The corresponding type in the .NET Framework is the <xref:System.Char?displayProperty=fullName> structure.
