# ^= Operator (Visual Basic)
Raises the value of a variable or property to the power of an expression and assigns the result back to the variable or property.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
variableorproperty ^= expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `variableorproperty`  
 Required. Any numeric variable or property.  
  
 `expression`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The element on the left side of the `^=` operator can be a simple scalar variable, a property, or an element of an array. The variable or property cannot be [ReadOnly](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/readonly.md).  
  
 The `^=` operator first raises the value of the variable or property (on the left-hand side of the operator) to the power of the value of the expression (on the right-hand side of the operator). The operator then assigns the result of that operation back to the variable or property.  
  
 Visual Basic always performs exponentiation in the [Double Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/double-data-type.md). Operands of any different type are converted to `Double`, and the result is always `Double`.  
  
 The value of `expression` can be fractional, negative, or both.  
  
## Overloading  
 The [^ Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/exponentiation-operator.md) can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. Overloading the `^` operator affects the behavior of the `^=` operator. If your code uses `^=` on a class or structure that overloads `^`, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `^=` operator to raise the value of one `Integer` variable to the power of a second variable and assign the result to the first variable.
