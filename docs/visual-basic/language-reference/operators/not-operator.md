# Not Operator (Visual Basic)
Performs logical negation on a `Boolean` expression, or bitwise negation on a numeric expression.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
result = Not expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `result`  
 Required. Any `Boolean` or numeric expression.  
  
 `expression`  
 Required. Any `Boolean` or numeric expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 For `Boolean` expressions, the following table illustrates how `result` is determined.  
  
|If `expression` is|The value of `result` is|  
|------------------------|------------------------------|  
|`True`|`False`|  
|`False`|`True`|  
  
 For numeric expressions, the `Not` operator inverts the bit values of any numeric expression and sets the corresponding bit in `result` according to the following table.  
  
|If bit in `expression` is|The bit in `result` is|  
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|  
|1|0|  
|0|1|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Since the logical and bitwise operators have a lower precedence than other arithmetic and relational operators, any bitwise operations should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure accurate execution.  
  
## Data Types  
 For a Boolean negation, the data type of the result is `Boolean`. For a bitwise negation, the result data type is the same as that of `expression`. However, if expression is `Decimal`, the result is `Long`.  
  
## Overloading  
 The `Not` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when its operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `Not` operator to perform logical negation on a `Boolean` expression. The result is a `Boolean` value that represents the reverse of the value of the expression.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#33](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/not-operator_1.vb)]  
  
 The preceding example produces results of `False` and `True`, respectively.  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `Not` operator to perform logical negation of the individual bits of a numeric expression. The bit in the result pattern is set to the reverse of the corresponding bit in the operand pattern, including the sign bit.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#34](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/not-operator_2.vb)]  
  
 The preceding example produces results of –11, –9, and –7, respectively.
