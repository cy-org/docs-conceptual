# ^ Operator (Visual Basic)
Raises a number to the power of another number.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
number ^ exponent  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `number`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
 `exponent`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
## Result  
 The result is `number` raised to the power of `exponent`, always as a `Double` value.  
  
## Supported Types  
 `Double`. Operands of any different type are converted to `Double`.  
  
## Remarks  
 Visual Basic always performs exponentiation in the [Double Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/double-data-type.md).  
  
 The value of `exponent` can be fractional, negative, or both.  
  
 When more than one exponentiation is performed in a single expression, the `^` operator is evaluated as it is encountered from left to right.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `^` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `^` operator to raise a number to the power of an exponent. The result is the first operand raised to the power of the second.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#20](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/exponentiation-operator_1.vb)]  
  
 The preceding example produces the following results:  
  
 `exp1` is set to 4 (2 squared).  
  
 `exp2` is set to 19683 (3 cubed, then that value cubed).  
  
 `exp3` is set to -125 (-5 cubed).  
  
 `exp4` is set to 625 (-5 to the fourth power).  
  
 `exp5` is set to 2 (cube root of 8).  
  
 `exp6` is set to 0.5 (1.0 divided by the cube root of 8).  
  
 Note the importance of the parentheses in the expressions in the preceding example. Because of *operator precedence*, Visual Basic normally performs the `^` operator before any others, even the unary `–` operator. If `exp4` and `exp6` had been calculated without parentheses, they would have produced the following results:  
  
 `exp4 = -5 ^ 4` would be calculated as –(5 to the fourth power), which would result in -625.  
  
 `exp6 = 8 ^ -1.0 / 3.0` would be calculated as (8 to the –1 power, or 0.125) divided by 3.0, which would result in 0.041666666666666666666666666666667.
