# *= Operator (Visual Basic)
Multiplies the value of a variable or property by the value of an expression and assigns the result to the variable or property.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
variableorproperty *= expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `variableorproperty`  
 Required. Any numeric variable or property.  
  
 `expression`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The element on the left side of the `*=` operator can be a simple scalar variable, a property, or an element of an array. The variable or property cannot be [ReadOnly](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/readonly.md).  
  
 The `*=` operator first multiplies the value of the expression (on the right-hand side of the operator) by the value of the variable or property (on the left-hand side of the operator). The operator then assigns the result of that operation to the variable or property.  
  
## Overloading  
 The [* Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/multiplication-operator.md) can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. Overloading the `*` operator affects the behavior of the `*=` operator. If your code uses `*=` on a class or structure that overloads `*`, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `*=` operator to multiply one `Integer` variable by a second and assign the result to the first variable.
