# - Operator (Visual Basic)
Returns the difference between two numeric expressions or the negative value of a numeric expression.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
      expression1 – expression2  
- or -  
– expression1  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `expression1`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
 `expression2`  
 Required unless the `–` operator is calculating a negative value. Any numeric expression.  
  
## Result  
 The result is the difference between `expression1` and `expression2`, or the negated value of `expression1`.  
  
 The result data type is a numeric type appropriate for the data types of `expression1` and `expression2`. See the "Integer Arithmetic" tables in [Data Types of Operator Results](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/data-types-of-operator-results.md).  
  
## Supported Types  
 All numeric types. This includes the unsigned and floating-point types and `Decimal`.  
  
## Remarks  
 In the first usage shown in the syntax shown previously, the `–` operator is the *binary* arithmetic subtraction operator for the difference between two numeric expressions.  
  
 In the second usage shown in the syntax shown previously, the `–` operator is the *unary* negation operator for the negative value of an expression. In this sense, the negation consists of reversing the sign of `expression1` so that the result is positive if `expression1` is negative.  
  
 If either expression evaluates to [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md), the `–` operator treats it as zero.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The `–` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, make sure that you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `–` operator to calculate and return the difference between two numbers, and then to negate a number.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#10](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/subtraction-operator_1.vb)]  
  
 Following the execution of these statements, `binaryResult` contains 124.45 and `unaryResult` contains –334.90.
