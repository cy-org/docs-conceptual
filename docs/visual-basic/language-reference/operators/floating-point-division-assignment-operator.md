# /= Operator (Visual Basic)
Divides the value of a variable or property by the value of an expression and assigns the floating-point result to the variable or property.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
variableorproperty /= expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `variableorproperty`  
 Required. Any numeric variable or property.  
  
 `expression`  
 Required. Any numeric expression.  
  
## Remarks  
 The element on the left side of the `/=` operator can be a simple scalar variable, a property, or an element of an array. The variable or property cannot be [ReadOnly](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/readonly.md).  
  
 The `/=` operator first divides the value of the variable or property (on the left-hand side of the operator) by the value of the expression (on the right-hand side of the operator). The operator then assigns the floating-point result of that operation to the variable or property.  
  
 This statement assigns a `Double` value to the variable or property on the left. If `Option Strict` is `On`, `variableorproperty` must be a `Double`. If `Option Strict` is `Off`, Visual Basic performs an implicit conversion and assigns the resulting value to `variableorproperty`, with a possible error at run time. For more information, see [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md) and [Option Strict Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-strict-statement.md).  
  
## Overloading  
 The [/ Operator (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/floating-point-division-operator.md) can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. Overloading the `/` operator affects the behavior of the `/=` operator. If your code uses `/=` on a class or structure that overloads `/`, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `/=` operator to divide one `Integer` variable by a second and assign the quotient to the first variable.
