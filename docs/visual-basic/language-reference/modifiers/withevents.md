# WithEvents (Visual Basic)
Specifies that one or more declared member variables refer to an instance of a class that can raise events.  
  
## Remarks  
 When a variable is defined using `WithEvents`, you can declaratively specify that a method handles the variable's events using the `Handles` keyword.  
  
 You can use `WithEvents` only at class or module level. This means the declaration context for a `WithEvents` variable must be a class or module and cannot be a source file, namespace, structure, or procedure.  
  
 You cannot use `WithEvents` on a structure member.  
  
 You can declare only individual variables—not arrays—with `WithEvents`.  
  
## Rules  
  
-   **Element Types.** You must declare `WithEvents` variables to be object variables so that they can accept class instances. However, you cannot declare them as `Object`. You must declare them as the specific class that can raise the events.  
  
 The `WithEvents` modifier can be used in this context: [Dim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)
