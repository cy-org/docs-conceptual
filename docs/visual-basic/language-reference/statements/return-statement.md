# Return Statement (Visual Basic)
Returns control to the code that called a `Function`, `Sub`, `Get`, `Set`, or `Operator` procedure.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Return  
-or-  
Return expression  
```  
  
## Part  
 `expression`  
 Required in a `Function`, `Get`, or `Operator` procedure. Expression that represents the value to be returned to the calling code.  
  
## Remarks  
 In a `Sub` or `Set` procedure, the `Return` statement is equivalent to an `Exit Sub` or `Exit Property` statement, and `expression` must not be supplied.  
  
 In a `Function`, `Get`, or `Operator` procedure, the `Return` statement must include `expression`, and `expression` must evaluate to a data type that is convertible to the return type of the procedure. In a `Function` or `Get` procedure, you also have the alternative of assigning an expression to the procedure name to serve as the return value, and then executing an `Exit Function` or `Exit Property` statement. In an `Operator` procedure, you must use `Return``expression`.  
  
 You can include as many `Return` statements as appropriate in the same procedure.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The code in a `Finally` block runs after a `Return` statement in a `Try` or `Catch` block is encountered, but before that `Return` statement executes. A `Return` statement cannot be included in a `Finally` block.  
  
## Example  
 The following example uses the `Return` statement several times to return to the calling code when the procedure does not have to do anything else.
