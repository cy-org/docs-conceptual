# Throw Statement (Visual Basic)
Throws an exception within a procedure.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Throw [ expression ]  
```  
  
## Part  
 `expression`  
 Provides information about the exception to be thrown. Optional when residing in a `Catch` statement, otherwise required.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Throw` statement throws an exception that you can handle with structured exception-handling code (`Try`...`Catch`...`Finally`) or unstructured exception-handling code (`On Error GoTo`). You can use the `Throw` statement to trap errors within your code because Visual Basic moves up the call stack until it finds the appropriate exception-handling code.  
  
 A `Throw` statement with no expression can only be used in a `Catch` statement, in which case the statement rethrows the exception currently being handled by the `Catch` statement.  
  
 The `Throw` statement resets the call stack for the `expression` exception. If `expression` is not provided, the call stack is left unchanged. You can access the call stack for the exception through the <xref:System.Exception.StackTrace%2A> property.  
  
## Example  
 The following code uses the `Throw` statement to throw an exception:  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#84](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/throw-statement_1.vb)]  
  
## Requirements  
 **Namespace:** [Microsoft.VisualBasic](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/runtime-library-members.md)  
  
 **Module:** `Interaction`  
  
 **Assembly:** Visual Basic Runtime Library (in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll)
