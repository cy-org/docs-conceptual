# Implements Clause (Visual Basic)
Indicates that a class or structure member is providing the implementation for a member defined in an interface.  
  
## Remarks  
The `Implements` keyword is not the same as the [Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md). You use the `Implements` statement to specify that a class or structure implements one or more interfaces, and then for each member you use the `Implements` keyword to specify which interface and which member it implements.

If a class or structure implements an interface, it must include the `Implements` statement immediately after the [Class Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/class-statement.md) or [Structure Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md), and it must implement all the members defined by the interface.

## Reimplementation  
In a derived class, you can reimplement an interface member that the base class has already implemented. This is different from overriding the base class member in the following respects:

- The base class member does not need to be [Overridable](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overridable.md) to be reimplemented.
- You can reimplement the member with a different name.

The `Implements` keyword can be used in the following contexts:
- [Event Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/event-statement.md)
- [Function Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md)
- [Property Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md)
- [Sub Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/sub-statement.md)
