# Skip Clause (Visual Basic)
Bypasses a specified number of elements in a collection and then returns the remaining elements.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Skip count  
```  
  
## Parts  
 `count`  
 Required. A value or an expression that evaluates to the number of elements of the sequence to skip.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Skip` clause causes a query to bypass elements at the beginning of a results list and return the remaining elements. The number of elements to skip is identified by the `count` parameter.  
  
 You can use the `Skip` clause with the `Take` clause to return a range of data from any segment of a query. To do this, pass the index of the first element of the range to the `Skip` clause and the size of the range to the `Take` clause.  
  
 When you use the `Skip` clause in a query, you may also need to ensure that the results are returned in an order that will enable the `Skip` clause to bypass the intended results. For more information about ordering query results, see [Order By Clause](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/order-by-clause.md).  
  
 You can use the `SkipWhile` clause to specify that only certain elements are ignored, depending on a supplied condition.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example uses the `Skip` clause together with the `Take` clause to return data from a query in pages. The `GetCustomers` function uses the `Skip` clause to bypass the customers in the list until the supplied starting index value, and uses the `Take` clause to return a page of customers starting from that index value.
