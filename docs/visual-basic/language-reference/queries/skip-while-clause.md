# Skip While Clause (Visual Basic)
Bypasses elements in a collection as long as a specified condition is `true` and then returns the remaining elements.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Skip While expression  
```  
  
## Parts  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|---|---|  
|`expression`|Required. An expression that represents a condition to test elements for. The expression must return a `Boolean` value or a functional equivalent, such as an `Integer` to be evaluated as a `Boolean`.|  
  
## Remarks  
 The `Skip While` clause bypasses elements from the beginning of a query result until the supplied `expression` returns `false`. After `expression` returns `false`, the query returns all the remaining elements. The `expression` is ignored for the remaining results.  
  
 The `Skip While` clause differs from the `Where` clause in that the `Where` clause can be used to exclude all elements from a query that do not meet a particular condition. The `Skip While` clause excludes elements only until the first time that the condition is not satisfied. The `Skip While` clause is most useful when you are working with an ordered query result.  
  
 You can bypass a specific number of results from the beginning of a query result by using the `Skip` clause.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example uses the `Skip While` clause to bypass results until the first customer from the United States is found.
