# &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot expose type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; outside the project through &lt;containertype&gt; &#39;&lt;containertypename&gt;&#39;
A variable, procedure parameter, or function return is exposed outside its container, but it is declared as a type that must not be exposed outside the container.  
  
 The following skeleton code shows a situation that generates this error.  
  
```  
Private Class privateClass  
End Class  
Public Class mainClass  
    Public exposedVar As New privateClass  
End Class  
```  
  
 A type that is declared `Protected`, `Friend`, `Protected Friend`, or `Private` is intended to have limited access outside its declaration context. Using it as the data type of a variable with less restricted access would defeat this purpose. In the preceding skeleton code, `exposedVar` is `Public` and would expose `privateClass` to code that should not have access to it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30909  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the access level of the variable, procedure parameter, or function return to be at least as restrictive as the access level of its data type.
