# Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size
An array in a structure is declared with an initial size. You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31043  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).  
  
2.  If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running. The following example illustrates this.  
  
    ```  
    Structure demoStruct  
        Public demoArray() As Integer  
    End Structure  
    Sub useStruct()  
        Dim struct As demoStruct  
        ReDim struct.demoArray(9)  
        Struct.demoArray(2) = 777  
    End Sub  
    ```
