# Range variable name can be inferred only from a simple or qualified name with no arguments
A programming element that takes one or more arguments is included in a LINQ query. The compiler is unable to infer a range variable from that programming element.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36599  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Supply an explicit variable name for the programming element, as shown in the following code:  
  
```  
Dim query = From var1 In collection1   
            Select VariableAlias= SampleFunction(var1), var1  
```
