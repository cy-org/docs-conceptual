# Type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; has no constructors
A type does not support a call to `Sub New()`. One possible cause is a corrupted compiler or binary file.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30251  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If the type is in a different project or in a referenced file, reinstall the project or file.  
  
2.  If the type is in the same project, recompile the assembly containing the type.  
  
3.  If the error recurs, reinstall the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler.  
  
4.  If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.
