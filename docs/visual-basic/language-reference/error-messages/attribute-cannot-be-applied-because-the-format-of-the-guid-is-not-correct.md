# &#39;&lt;attribute&gt;&#39; cannot be applied because the format of the GUID &#39;&lt;number&gt;&#39; is not correct
A `COMClassAttribute` attribute block specifies a globally unique identifier (GUID) that does not conform to the proper format for a GUID. `COMClassAttribute` uses GUIDs to uniquely identify the class, the interface, and the creation event.  
  
 A GUID consists of 16 bytes, of which the first eight are numeric and the last eight are binary. It is generated by Microsoft utilities such as uuidgen.exe and is guaranteed to be unique in space and time.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32500  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Determine the correct GUID or GUIDs necessary to identify the COM object.  
  
2.  Ensure that the GUID strings presented to the `COMClassAttribute` attribute block are copied correctly.
