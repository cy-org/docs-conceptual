# Class does not support Automation or does not support expected interface
Either the class you specified in the `GetObject` or `CreateObject` function call has not exposed a programmability interface, or you changed a project from .dll to .exe, or vice versa.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the documentation of the application that created the object for limitations on the use of automation with this class of object.  
  
2.  If you changed a project from .dll to .exe or vice versa, you must manually unregister the old .dll or .exe.
