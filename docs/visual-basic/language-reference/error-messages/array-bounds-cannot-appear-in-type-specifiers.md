# Array bounds cannot appear in type specifiers
Array sizes cannot be declared as part of a data type specifier.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30638  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Specify the size of the array immediately following the variable name instead of placing the array size after the type, as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```  
    Dim Array(8) As Integer   
    ```  
  
-   Define an array and initialize it with the desired number of elements, as shown in the following example.  
  
    ```  
    Dim Array2() As Integer = New Integer(8) {}  
    ```
