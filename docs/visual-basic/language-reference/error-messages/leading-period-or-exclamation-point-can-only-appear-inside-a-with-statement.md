# Leading &#39;.&#39; or &#39;!&#39; can only appear inside a &#39;With&#39; statement
A period (.) or exclamation point (!) that is not inside a `With` block occurs without an expression on the left. Member access (`.`) and dictionary member access (`!`) require an expression specifying the element that contains the member. This must appear immediately to the left of the accessor or as the target of a `With` block containing the member access.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30157  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the `With` block is correctly formatted.  
  
2.  If there is no `With` block, add an expression to the left of the accessor that evaluates to a defined element containing the member.
