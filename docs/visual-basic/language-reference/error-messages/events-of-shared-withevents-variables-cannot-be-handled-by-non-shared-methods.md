# Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods
A variable declared with the `Shared` modifier is a shared variable. A shared variable identifies exactly one storage location. A variable declared with the `WithEvents` modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises. When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the `WithEvents` declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the `Add` method.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30594  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Declare your event handler `Shared`.
