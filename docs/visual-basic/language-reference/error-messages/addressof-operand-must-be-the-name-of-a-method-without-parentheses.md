# &#39;AddressOf&#39; operand must be the name of a method (without parentheses)
The `AddressOf` operator creates a procedure delegate instance that references a specific procedure. The syntax is as follows.  
  
 `AddressOf` `procedurename`  
  
 You inserted parentheses around the argument following `AddressOf`, where none are needed.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30577  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the parentheses around the argument following `AddressOf`.  
  
2.  Make sure the argument is a method name.
