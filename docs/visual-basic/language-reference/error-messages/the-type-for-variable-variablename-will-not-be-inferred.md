# The type for variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; will not be inferred because it is bound to a field in an enclosing scope
The type for variable '\<variablename>' will not be inferred because it is bound to a field in an enclosing scope. Either change the name of '\<variablename>', or use the fully qualified name (for example, 'Me.variablename' or 'MyBase.variablename').  
  
 A loop control variable in your code has the same name as a field of the class or other enclosing scope. Because the control variable is used without an `As` clause, it is bound to the field in the enclosing scope, and the compiler does not create a new variable for it or infer its type.  
  
 In the following example, `Index`, the control variable in the `For` statement, is bound to the `Index` field in the `Customer` class. The compiler does not create a new variable for the control variable `Index` or infer its type.  
  
```  
Class Customer  
  
    ' The class has a field named Index.  
    Private Index As Integer  
  
    Sub Main()  
  
    ' The following line will raise this warning.  
        For Index = 1 To 10  
            ' ...  
        Next  
  
    End Sub  
End Class  
```  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information about how to hide warnings or how to treat warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42110  
  
### To address this warning  
  
-   Make the loop control variable local by changing its name to an identifier that is not also the name of a field of the class.  
  
    ```  
    For I = 1 To 10  
    ```  
  
-   Clarify that the loop control variable binds to the class field by prefixing `Me.` to the variable name.  
  
    ```  
    For Me.Index = 1 To 10  
    ```  
  
-   Instead of relying on local type inference, use an `As` clause to specify a type for the loop control variable.  
  
    ```  
    For Index As Integer = 1 To 10  
    ```  
  
## Example  
 The following code shows the earlier example with the first correction in place.  
  
```  
Class Customer  
  
    ' The class has a field named Index.  
    Private Index As Integer  
  
    Sub Main()  
  
        For I = 1 To 10  
            ' ...  
        Next  
  
    End Sub  
End Class  
```
