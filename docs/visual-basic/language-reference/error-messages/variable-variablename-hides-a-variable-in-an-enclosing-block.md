# Variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; hides a variable in an enclosing block
A variable enclosed in a block has the same name as another local variable.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30616  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Rename the variable in the enclosed block so that it is not the same as any other local variables. For example:  
  
    ```  
    Dim a, b, x As Integer  
    If a = b Then  
       Dim y As Integer = 20 ' Uniquely named block variable.  
    End If  
    ```  
  
-   A common cause for this error is the use of `Catch e As Exception` inside an event handler. If this is the case, name the `Catch` block variable `ex` rather than `e`.  
  
-   Another common source of this error is an attempt to access a local variable declared within a `Try` block in a separate `Catch` block. To correct this, declare the variable outside the `Try...Catch...Finally` structure.
