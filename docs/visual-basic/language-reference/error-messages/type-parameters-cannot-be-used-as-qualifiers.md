# Type parameters cannot be used as qualifiers
A programming element is qualified with a qualification string that includes a type parameter.  
  
 A type parameter represents a requirement for a type that is to be supplied when the generic type is constructed. It does not represent a specific defined type. A qualification string must include only elements that are defined at compile time.  
  
 The following statements can generate this error.  
  
```  
Public Function checkText(Of c As System.Windows.Forms.Control)(  
    ByVal badText As String) As Boolean  
  
    Dim saveText As c.Text  
    ' Insert code to look for badText within saveText.  
End Function  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32098  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the type parameter from the qualification string, or replace it with a defined type.  
  
2.  If you need to use a constructed type to locate the programming element being qualified, you must use additional program logic.
