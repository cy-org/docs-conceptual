# &#39;&lt;eventname&gt;&#39; is an event, and cannot be called directly
'<`eventname`>' is an event, and so cannot be called directly. Use a `RaiseEvent` statement to raise an event.  
  
 A procedure call specifies an event for the procedure name. An event handler is a procedure, but the event itself is a signaling device, which must be raised and handled.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32022  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Use a `RaiseEvent` statement to signal an event and invoke the procedure or procedures that handle it.  
  
## See Also  
 [RaiseEvent Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/raiseevent-statement.md)
