# Structure &#39;&lt;structurename&gt;&#39; must contain at least one instance member variable or at least one instance event declaration not marked &#39;Custom&#39;
A structure definition does not include any nonshared variables or nonshared noncustom events.  
  
 Every structure must have either a variable or an event that applies to each specific instance (nonshared) instead of to all instances collectively ([Shared](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)). Nonshared constants, properties, and procedures do not satisfy this requirement. In addition, if there are no nonshared variables and only one nonshared event, that event cannot be a `Custom` event.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30941  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Define at least one variable or event that is not `Shared`. If you define only one event, it must be noncustom as well as nonshared.
