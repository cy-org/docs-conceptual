# Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object
Certain properties, methods, and operations can only apply to `Collection` objects. You specified an operation or property that is exclusive to collections, but the object is not a collection.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Check the spelling of the object or property name, or verify that the object is a `Collection` object.  
  
2.  Look at the `Add` method used to add the object to the collection to be sure the syntax is correct and that any identifiers were spelled correctly.
