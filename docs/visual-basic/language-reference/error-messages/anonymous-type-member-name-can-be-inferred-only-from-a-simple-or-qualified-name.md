# Anonymous type member name can be inferred only from a simple or qualified name with no arguments
You cannot infer an anonymous type member name from a complex expression.  
  
```vb  
Dim numbers() As Integer = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
' Not valid.  
' Dim instanceName1 = New With {numbers(3)}  
```  
  
 For more information about sources from which anonymous types can and cannot infer member names and types, see [How to: Infer Property Names and Types in Anonymous Type Declarations](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36556  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Assign the expression to a member name, as shown in the following code:  
  
    ```  
    Dim instanceName2 = New With {.number = numbers(3)}  
    ```
