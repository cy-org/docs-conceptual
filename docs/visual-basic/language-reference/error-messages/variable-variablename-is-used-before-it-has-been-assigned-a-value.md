# Variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; is used before it has been assigned a value
Variable '\<variablename>' is used before it has been assigned a value. A null reference exception could result at run time.  
  
 An application has at least one possible path through its code that reads a variable before any value is assigned to it.  
  
 If a variable has never been assigned a value, it holds the default value for its data type. For a reference data type, that default value is [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md). Reading a reference variable that has a value of `Nothing` can cause a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> in some circumstances.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42104  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check your control flow logic and make sure the variable has a valid value before control passes to any statement that reads it.  
  
-   One way to guarantee that the variable always has a valid value is to initialize it as part of its declaration. See "Initialization" in [Dim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md).
