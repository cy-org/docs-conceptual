# &#39;&lt;interfacename&gt;.&lt;membername&gt;&#39; is already implemented by the base class &#39;&lt;baseclassname&gt;&#39;. Re-implementation of &lt;type&gt; assumed
A property, procedure, or event in a derived class uses an `Implements` clause specifying an interface member that is already implemented in the base class.  
  
 A derived class can reimplement an interface member that is implemented by its base class. This is not the same as overriding the base class implementation. For more information, see [Implements](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-clause.md).  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42015  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you intend to reimplement the interface member, you do not need to take any action. Code in your derived class accesses the reimplemented member unless you use the `MyBase` keyword to access the base class implementation.  
  
-   If you do not intend to reimplement the interface member, remove the `Implements` clause from the property, procedure, or event declaration.
