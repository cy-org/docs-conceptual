# Property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; doesn&#39;t return a value on all code paths
Property '\<propertyname>' doesn't return a value on all code paths. A null reference exception could occur at run time when the result is used.  
  
 A property `Get` procedure has at least one possible path through its code that does not return a value.  
  
 You can return a value from a property `Get` procedure in any of the following ways:  
  
-   Assign the value to the property name and then perform an `Exit Property` statement.  
  
-   Assign the value to the property name and then perform the `End Get` statement.  
  
-   Include the value in a [Return Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md).  
  
 If control passes to `Exit Property` or `End Get` and you have not assigned any value to the property name, the `Get` procedure returns the default value of the property's data type. For more information, see "Behavior" in [Function Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md).  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42107  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Check your control flow logic and make sure you assign a value before every statement that causes a return.  
  
     It is easier to guarantee that every return from the procedure returns a value if you always use the `Return` statement. If you do this, the last statement before `End Get` should be a `Return` statement.
