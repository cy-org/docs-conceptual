# Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &#39;Select Case&#39; statement
You cannot use a lambda expression for the test expression in a `Select Case` statement. Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a `Select Case` statement must be an elementary data type.  
  
 The following code causes this error:  
  
```vb  
' Select Case (Function(arg) arg Is Nothing)  
    ' List of the cases.  
' End Select  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36635  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement, would work for you.  
  
-   You may have intended to call the function, as shown in the following code:  
  
```vb  
Dim num? As Integer  
Select Case ((Function(arg? As Integer) arg Is Nothing)(num))  
    ' List of the cases  
End Select  
```
