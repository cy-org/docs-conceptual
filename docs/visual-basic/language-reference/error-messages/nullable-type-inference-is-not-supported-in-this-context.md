# Nullable type inference is not supported in this context
Value types and structures can be declared nullable.  
  
```vb  
Dim a? As Integer  
Dim b As Integer?  
```  
  
 However, you cannot use the nullable declaration in combination with type inference. The following examples cause this error.  
  
```vb  
' Not valid.  
' Dim c? = 10  
' Dim d? = a  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36629  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Use an `As` clause to declare the variable as nullable.
