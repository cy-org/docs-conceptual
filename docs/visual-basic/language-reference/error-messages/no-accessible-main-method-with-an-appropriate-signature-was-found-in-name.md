# No accessible &#39;Main&#39; method with an appropriate signature was found in &#39;&lt;name&gt;&#39;
Command-line applications must have a `Sub Main` defined. `Main` must be declared as `Public Shared` if it is defined in a class, or as `Public` if defined in a module.  
  
 For more information on `Main`, see [NIB: Visual Basic Version of Hello, World](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9d030b60-e148-4366-a462-69532f02294c).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30737  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Define a `Public Sub Main` procedure for your project. Declare it as `Shared` if and only if you define it inside a class.
