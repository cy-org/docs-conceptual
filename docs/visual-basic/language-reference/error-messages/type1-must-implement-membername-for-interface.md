# &lt;type1&gt;&#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; must implement &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; for interface &#39;&lt;interfacename&gt;&#39;
'\<typename>' must implement '\<membername>' for interface '\<interfacename>'. Implementing property must have matching 'ReadOnly'/'WriteOnly' specifiers.  
  
 A class or structure claims to implement an interface but does not implement a procedure, property, or event defined by the interface. Every member of the interface must be implemented.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30154  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare a member with the same name and signature as defined in the interface. Be sure to include at least the `End Function`, `End Sub`, or `End Property` statement.  
  
2.  Add an `Implements` clause to the end of the `Function`, `Sub`, `Property`, or `Event` statement. For example:  
  
    ```  
    Public Event ItHappened() Implements IBaseInterface.ItHappened  
    ```  
  
3.  When implementing a property, make sure that `ReadOnly` or `WriteOnly` is used in the same way as in the interface definition.  
  
4.  When implementing a property, declare `Get` and `Set` procedures, as appropriate.
