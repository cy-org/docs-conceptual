# Too many files
Either more files have been created in the root directory than the operating system permits, or more files have been opened than the number specified in the **files=** setting in your CONFIG.SYS file.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  If your program is opening, closing, or saving files in the root directory, change your program so that it uses a subdirectory.  
  
2.  Increase the number of files specified in your **files=** setting in your CONFIG.SYS file, and restart your computer.
