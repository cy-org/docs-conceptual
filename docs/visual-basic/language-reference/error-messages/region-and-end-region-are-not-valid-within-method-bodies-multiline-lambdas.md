# &#39;#Region&#39; and &#39;#End Region&#39; statements are not valid within method bodies/multiline lambdas
The `#Region` block must be declared at a class, module, or namespace level. A collapsible region can include one or more procedures, but it cannot begin or end inside of a procedure.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32025  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that the preceding procedure is properly terminated with an `End Function` or `End Sub` statement.  
  
2.  Ensure that the `#Region` and `#End Region` directives are in the same code block.
