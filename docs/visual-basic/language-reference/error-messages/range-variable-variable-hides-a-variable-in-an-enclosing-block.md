# Range variable &lt;variable&gt; hides a variable in an enclosing block, a previously defined range variable, or an implicitly declared variable in a query expression
A range variable name specified in a `Select`, `From`, `Aggregate`, or `Let` clause duplicates the name of a range variable already specified previously in the query, or the name of a variable that is implicitly declared by the query, such as a field name or the name of an aggregate function.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36633  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Ensure that all range variables in a particular query scope have unique names. You can enclose a query in parentheses to ensure that nested queries have a unique scope.
