# End of statement expected
The statement is syntactically complete, but an additional programming element follows the element that completes the statement. A line terminator is required at the end of every statement.
  
 A line terminator divides the characters of a Visual Basic source file into lines. Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character. For more information about line terminators, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](../../../visual-basic/reference/language-specification/index.md).
  
 **Error ID:** BC30205
  
## To correct this error
  
1.  Check to see if two different statements have inadvertently been put on the same line.
  
2.  Insert a line terminator after the element that completes the statement.
