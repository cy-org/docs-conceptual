# Statement cannot end a block outside of a line &#39;If&#39; statement
A single-line `If` statement contains several statements separated by colons (:), one of which is an `End` statement for a control block outside the single-line `If`. Single-line `If` statements do not use the `End If` statement.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32005  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Move the single-line `If` statement outside the control block that contains the `End If` statement.  
  
## See Also  
 [If...Then...Else Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)
