# Initializer expected
You have tried to declare an instance of a class by using an object initializer in which the initialization list is empty, as shown in the following example.  
  
 `' Not valid.`  
  
 `' Dim aStudent As New Student With {}`  
  
 At least one field or property must be initialized in the initializer list, as shown in the following example.  
  
 `Dim aStudent As New Student With {.year = "Senior"}`  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30996  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Initialize at least one field or property in the initializer, or do not use an object initializer.
