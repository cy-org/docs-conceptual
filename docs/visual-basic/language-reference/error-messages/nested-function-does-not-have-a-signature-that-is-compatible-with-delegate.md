# Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate &#39;&lt;delegatename&gt;&#39;
A lambda expression has been assigned to a delegate that has an incompatible signature. For example, in the following code, delegate `Del` has two integer parameters.  
  
```vb  
Delegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer, ByVal q As Integer) As Integer  
```  
  
 The error is raised if a lambda expression with one argument is declared as type `Del`:  
  
```vb  
' Neither of these is valid.   
' Dim lambda1 As Del = Function(n As Integer) n + 1  
' Dim lambda2 As Del = Function(n) n + 1  
```  
  
 **Error ID:** BC36532  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Adjust either the delegate definition or the assigned lambda expression so that the signatures are compatible.
