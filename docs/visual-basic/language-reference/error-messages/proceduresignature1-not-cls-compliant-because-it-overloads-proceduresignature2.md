# &lt;proceduresignature1&gt; is not CLS-compliant because it overloads &lt;proceduresignature2&gt; which differs from it only by array of array parameter types or by the rank of the array parameter types
A procedure or property is marked as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` when it overrides another procedure or property and the only difference between their parameter lists is the nesting level of a jagged array or the rank of an array.  
  
 In the following declarations, the second and third declarations generate this error.  
  
 `Overloads Sub processArray(ByVal arrayParam() As Integer)`  
  
 `Overloads Sub processArray(ByVal arrayParam()() As Integer)`  
  
 `Overloads Sub processArray(ByVal arrayParam(,) As Integer)`  
  
 The second declaration changes the original one-dimensional parameter `arrayParam` to an array of arrays. The third declaration changes `arrayParam` to a two-dimensional array (rank 2). While Visual Basic allows overloads to differ only by one of these changes, such overloading is not compliant with the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/12a7a7h3) (CLS).  
  
 When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40035  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you require CLS compliance, define your overloads to differ from each other in more ways than only the changes cited on this Help page.  
  
-   If you require that the overloads differ only by the changes cited on this Help page, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from their definitions or mark them as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.
