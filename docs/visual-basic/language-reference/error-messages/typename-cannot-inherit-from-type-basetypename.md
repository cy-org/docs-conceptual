# &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; cannot inherit from &lt;type&gt; &#39;&lt;basetypename&gt;&#39; because it expands the access of the base &lt;type&gt; outside the assembly
A class or interface inherits from a base class or interface but has a less restrictive access level.  
  
 For example, a `Public` interface inherits from a `Friend` interface, or a `Protected` class inherits from a `Private` class. This exposes the base class or interface to access beyond the intended level.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30910  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Change the access level of the derived class or interface to be at least as restrictive as that of the base class or interface.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   If you require the less restrictive access level, remove the `Inherits` statement. You cannot inherit from a more restricted base class or interface.
