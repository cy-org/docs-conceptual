# Sub or Function not defined (Visual Basic)
A `Sub` or `Function` must be defined in order to be called. Possible causes of this error include:  
  
-   Misspelling the procedure name.  
  
-   Trying to call a procedure from another project without explicitly adding a reference to that project in the **References** dialog box.  
  
-   Specifying a procedure that is not visible to the calling procedure.  
  
-   Declaring a Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) routine or Macintosh code-resource routine that is not in the specified library or code resource.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Make sure that the procedure name is spelled correctly.  
  
2.  Find the name of the project containing the procedure you want to call in the **References** dialog box. If it does not appear, click the **Browse** button to search for it. Select the check box to the left of the project name, and then click **OK**.  
  
3.  Check the name of the routine.
