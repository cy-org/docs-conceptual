# A property or method call cannot include a reference to a private object, either as an argument or as a return value
Among the possible causes of this error are:  
  
-   A client invoked a property or method of an out-of-process component and attempted to pass a reference to a private object as one of the arguments.  
  
-   An out-of-process component invoked a call-back method on its client and attempted to pass a reference to a private object.  
  
-   An out-of-process component attempted to pass a reference to a private object as an argument of an event it was raising.  
  
-   A client attempted to assign a private object reference to a `ByRef` argument of an event it was handling.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
1.  Remove the reference.
