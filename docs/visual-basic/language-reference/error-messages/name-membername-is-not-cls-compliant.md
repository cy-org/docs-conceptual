# Name &lt;membername&gt; is not CLS-compliant
An assembly is marked as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` but exposes a member with a name that begins with an underscore (`_`).  
  
 A programming element can contain one or more underscores, but to be compliant with the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/12a7a7h3) (CLS), it must not begin with an underscore. See [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md).  
  
 When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40031  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   If you have control over the source code, change the member name so that it does not begin with an underscore.  
  
-   If you require that the member name remain unchanged, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`. You can still mark the assembly as `<CLSCompliant(True)>`.
