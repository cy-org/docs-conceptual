# How to: Create XML Documentation in Visual Basic
This example shows how to add XML documentation comments to your code.  
  
[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](~/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  
  
### To create XML documentation for a type or member  
  
1.  In the **Code Editor**, position your cursor on the line above the type or member for which you want to create documentation.  
  
2.  Type `'''` (three single-quotation marks).  
  
     An XML skeleton for the type or member is added in the **Code Editor**.  
  
3.  Add descriptive information between the appropriate tags.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If you add additional lines within the XML documentation block, each line must begin with `'''`.  
  
4.  Add additional code that uses the type or member with the new XML documentation comments.  
  
     IntelliSense displays the text from the \<summary> tag for the type or member.  
  
5.  Compile the code to generate an XML file containing the documentation comments. For more information, see [/doc](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/doc.md).
