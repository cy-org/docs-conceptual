# How to: Label Statements (Visual Basic)
Statement blocks are made up of lines of code delimited by colons. Lines of code preceded by an identifying string or integer are said to be *labeled*. Statement labels are used to mark a line of code to identify it for use with statements such as `On Error Goto`.  
  
 Labels may be either valid Visual Basic identifiers—such as those that identify programming elements—or integer literals. A label must appear at the beginning of a line of source code and must be followed by a colon, regardless of whether it is followed by a statement on the same line.  
  
 The compiler identifies labels by checking whether the beginning of the line matches any already-defined identifier. If it does not, the compiler assumes it is a label.  
  
 Labels have their own declaration space and do not interfere with other identifiers. A label's scope is the body of the method. Label declaration takes precedence in any ambiguous situation.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Labels can be used only on executable statements inside methods.  
  
### To label a line of code  
  
-   Place an identifier, followed by a colon, at the beginning of the line of source code.  
  
     For example, the following lines of code are labeled with `Jump` and `120`, respectively:
