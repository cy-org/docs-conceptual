# How to: Use a Thread Pool (Visual Basic)
*Thread pooling* is a form of multithreading in which tasks are added to a queue and automatically started when threads are created. For more information, see [Thread Pooling (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/threading/thread-pooling.md).  
  
 The following example uses the .NET Framework thread pool to calculate the `Fibonacci` result for ten numbers between 20 and 40. Each `Fibonacci` result is represented by the `Fibonacci` class, which provides a method named `ThreadPoolCallback` that performs the calculation. An object that represents each `Fibonacci` value is created, and the `ThreadPoolCallback` method is passed to <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%2A>, which assigns an available thread in the pool to execute the method.  
  
 Because each `Fibonacci` object is given a semi-random value to compute, and because each thread will be competing for processor time, you cannot know in advance how long it will take for all ten results to be calculated. That is why each `Fibonacci` object is passed an instance of the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent> class during construction. Each object signals the provided event object when its calculation is complete, which allows the primary thread to block execution with <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A> until all ten `Fibonacci` objects have calculated a result. The `Main` method then displays each `Fibonacci` result.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Imports System.Threading  
  
Module Module1  
  
    Public Class Fibonacci  
        Private _n As Integer  
        Private _fibOfN  
        Private _doneEvent As ManualResetEvent  
  
        Public ReadOnly Property N() As Integer  
            Get  
                Return _n  
            End Get  
        End Property  
  
        Public ReadOnly Property FibOfN() As Integer  
            Get  
                Return _fibOfN  
            End Get  
        End Property  
  
        Sub New(ByVal n As Integer, ByVal doneEvent As ManualResetEvent)  
            _n = n  
            _doneEvent = doneEvent  
        End Sub  
  
        ' Wrapper method for use with the thread pool.  
        Public Sub ThreadPoolCallBack(ByVal threadContext As Object)  
            Dim threadIndex As Integer = CType(threadContext, Integer)  
            Console.WriteLine("thread {0} started...", threadIndex)  
            _fibOfN = Calculate(_n)  
            Console.WriteLine("thread {0} result calculated...", threadIndex)  
            _doneEvent.Set()  
        End Sub  
  
        Public Function Calculate(ByVal n As Integer) As Integer  
            If n <= 1 Then  
                Return n  
            End If  
            Return Calculate(n - 1) + Calculate(n - 2)  
        End Function  
  
    End Class  
  
    <MTAThread()>   
    Sub Main()  
        Const FibonacciCalculations As Integer = 9 ' 0 to 9  
  
        ' One event is used for each Fibonacci object  
        Dim doneEvents(FibonacciCalculations) As ManualResetEvent  
        Dim fibArray(FibonacciCalculations) As Fibonacci  
        Dim r As New Random()  
  
        ' Configure and start threads using ThreadPool.  
        Console.WriteLine("launching {0} tasks...", FibonacciCalculations)  
  
        For i As Integer = 0 To FibonacciCalculations  
            doneEvents(i) = New ManualResetEvent(False)  
            Dim f = New Fibonacci(r.Next(20, 40), doneEvents(i))  
            fibArray(i) = f  
            ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(AddressOf f.ThreadPoolCallBack, i)  
        Next  
  
        ' Wait for all threads in pool to calculate.  
        WaitHandle.WaitAll(doneEvents)  
        Console.WriteLine("All calculations are complete.")  
  
        ' Display the results.  
        For i As Integer = 0 To FibonacciCalculations  
            Dim f As Fibonacci = fibArray(i)  
            Console.WriteLine("Fibonacci({0}) = {1}", f.N, f.FibOfN)  
        Next  
    End Sub  
  
End Module  
```  
  
 Following is an example of the output.  
  
```  
launching 10 tasks...  
thread 0 started...  
thread 1 started...  
thread 1 result calculated...  
thread 2 started...  
thread 2 result calculated...  
thread 3 started...  
thread 3 result calculated...  
thread 4 started...  
thread 0 result calculated...  
thread 5 started...  
thread 5 result calculated...  
thread 6 started...  
thread 4 result calculated...  
thread 7 started...  
thread 6 result calculated...  
thread 8 started...  
thread 8 result calculated...  
thread 9 started...  
thread 9 result calculated...  
thread 7 result calculated...  
All calculations are complete.

Fibonacci(25) = 75025  
Fibonacci(22) = 17711
