# How to: Create and Use Assemblies Using the Command Line (Visual Basic)
An assembly, or a dynamic linking library (DLL), is linked to your program at run time. To demonstrate building and using a DLL, consider the following scenario:  
  
-   `MathLibrary.DLL`: The library file that contains the methods to be called at run time. In this example, the DLL contains two methods, `Add` and `Multiply`.  
  
-   `Add`: The source file that contains the method `Add`. It returns the sum of its parameters. The class `AddClass` that contains the method `Add` is a member of the namespace `UtilityMethods`.  
  
-   `Mult`: The source code that contains the method `Multiply`. It returns the product of its parameters. The class `MultiplyClass` that contains the method `Multiply` is also a member of the namespace `UtilityMethods`.  
  
-   `TestCode`: The file that contains the `Main` method. It uses the methods in the DLL file to calculate the sum and the product of the run-time arguments.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
' File: Add.vb   
Namespace UtilityMethods  
    Public Class AddClass  
        Public Shared Function Add(ByVal i As Long, ByVal j As Long) As Long  
            Return i + j  
        End Function  
    End Class  
End Namespace  
```  
  
```vb  
' File: Mult.vb  
Namespace UtilityMethods  
    Public Class MultiplyClass  
        Public Shared Function Multiply(ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long) As Long  
            Return x * y  
        End Function  
    End Class  
End Namespace  
```  
  
```vb  
' File: TestCode.vb  
  
Imports UtilityMethods  
  
Module Test  
  
    Sub Main(ByVal args As String())  
  
        System.Console.WriteLine("Calling methods from MathLibrary.DLL:")  
  
        If args.Length <> 2 Then  
            System.Console.WriteLine("Usage: TestCode <num1> <num2>")  
            Return  
        End If  
  
        Dim num1 As Long = Long.Parse(args(0))  
        Dim num2 As Long = Long.Parse(args(1))  
  
        Dim sum As Long = AddClass.Add(num1, num2)  
        Dim product As Long = MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2)  
  
        System.Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", num1, num2, sum)  
        System.Console.WriteLine("{0} * {1} = {2}", num1, num2, product)  
  
    End Sub  
  
End Module  
  
' Output (assuming 1234 and 5678 are entered as command-line arguments):  
' Calling methods from MathLibrary.DLL:  
' 1234 + 5678 = 6912  
' 1234 * 5678 = 7006652  
```  
  
 This file contains the algorithm that uses the DLL methods, `Add` and `Multiply`. It starts with parsing the arguments entered from the command line, `num1` and `num2`. Then it calculates the sum by using the `Add` method on the `AddClass` class, and the product by using the `Multiply` method on the `MultiplyClass` class.  
  
 Notice that the  `Imports` statement at the beginning of the file enables you to use the unqualified class names to reference the DLL methods at compile time, as follows:  
  
```vb  
MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2)  
```  
  
 Otherwise, you have to use the fully qualified names, as follows:  
  
```vb  
UtilityMethods.MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2)  
```  
  
## Execution  
 To run the program, enter the name of the EXE file, followed by two numbers, as follows:  
  
 `TestCode 1234 5678`  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 To build the file `MathLibrary.DLL`, compile the two files `Add` and `Mult` by using the following command line.  
  
```vb  
vbc /target:library /out:MathLibrary.DLL Add.vb Mult.vb  
```  
  
 The [/target (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/target.md) compiler option tells the compiler to output a DLL instead of an EXE file. The [/out (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/out.md) compiler option followed by a file name is used to specify the DLL file name. Otherwise, the compiler uses the first file (`Add.vb`) as the name of the DLL.  
  
 To build the executable file, `TestCode.exe`, use the following command line:  
  
```vb  
vbc /out:TestCode.exe /reference:MathLibrary.DLL TestCode.vb  
```  
  
 The **/out** compiler option tells the compiler to output an EXE file and specifies the name of the output file (`TestCode.exe`). This compiler option is optional. The [/reference (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/reference.md) compiler option specifies the DLL file or files that this program uses.
