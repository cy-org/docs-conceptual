# How to: Control the Type of a Projection (Visual Basic)
Projection is the process of taking one set of data, filtering it, changing its shape, and even changing its type. Most query expressions perform projections. Most of the query expressions shown in this section evaluate to <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, but you can control the type of the projection to create collections of other types. This topic shows how to do this.  
  
## Example  
 The following example defines a new type, `Customer`. The query expression then instantiates new `Customer` objects in the `Select` clause. This causes the type of the query expression to be <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> of `Customer`.  
  
 This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-customers-and-orders-linq-to-xml.md).  
  
```vb  
Public Class Customer  
    Private customerIDValue As String  
    Public Property CustomerID() As String  
        Get  
            Return customerIDValue  
        End Get  
        Set(ByVal value As String)  
            customerIDValue = value  
        End Set  
    End Property  
  
    Private companyNameValue As String  
    Public Property CompanyName() As String  
        Get  
            Return companyNameValue  
        End Get  
        Set(ByVal value As String)  
            companyNameValue = value  
        End Set  
    End Property  
  
    Private contactNameValue As String  
    Public Property ContactName() As String  
        Get  
            Return contactNameValue  
        End Get  
        Set(ByVal value As String)  
            contactNameValue = value  
        End Set  
    End Property  
  
    Public Sub New(ByVal customerID As String, _  
                   ByVal companyName As String, _  
                   ByVal contactName As String)  
        CustomerIDValue = customerID  
        CompanyNameValue = companyName  
        ContactNameValue = contactName  
    End Sub  
  
    Public Overrides Function ToString() As String  
        Return String.Format("{0}:{1}:{2}", Me.CustomerID, Me.CompanyName, Me.ContactName)  
    End Function  
End Class  
  
Sub Main()  
    Dim custOrd As XElement = XElement.Load("CustomersOrders.xml")  
    Dim custList As IEnumerable(Of Customer) = _  
        From el In custOrd.<Customers>.<Customer> _  
        Select New Customer( _  
            el.@<CustomerID>, _  
            el.<CompanyName>.Value, _  
            el.<ContactName>.Value _  
        )  
    For Each cust In custList  
        Console.WriteLine(cust)  
    Next  
End Sub  
```  
  
 This code produces the following output:  
  
```  
GREAL:Great Lakes Food Market:Howard Snyder  
HUNGC:Hungry Coyote Import Store:Yoshi Latimer  
LAZYK:Lazy K Kountry Store:John Steel  
LETSS:Let's Stop N Shop:Jaime Yorres  
```
