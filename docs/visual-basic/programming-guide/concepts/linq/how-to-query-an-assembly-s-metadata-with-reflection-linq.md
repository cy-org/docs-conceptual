# How to: Query An Assembly&#39;s Metadata with Reflection (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
The following example shows how LINQ can be used with reflection to retrieve specific metadata about methods that match a specified search criterion. In this case, the query will find the names of all the methods in the assembly that return enumerable types such as arrays.  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Imports System.Reflection  
Imports System.IO  
Imports System.Linq  
Module Module1  
  
    Sub Main()  
        Dim asmbly As Assembly =   
            Assembly.Load("System.Core, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken= b77a5c561934e089")  
  
        Dim pubTypesQuery = From type In asmbly.GetTypes()   
                            Where type.IsPublic   
                            From method In type.GetMethods()   
                            Where method.ReturnType.IsArray = True   
                            Let name = method.ToString()   
                            Let typeName = type.ToString()   
                            Group name By typeName Into methodNames = Group  
  
        Console.WriteLine("Getting ready to iterate")  
        For Each item In pubTypesQuery  
            Console.WriteLine(item.methodNames)  
  
            For Each type In item.methodNames  
                Console.WriteLine(" " & type)  
            Next  
        Next  
        Console.ReadKey()  
    End Sub  
  
End Module  
```  
  
 The example uses the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetTypes%2A> method to return an array of types in the specified assembly. The [Where Clause](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/where-clause.md) filter is applied so that only public types are returned. For each public type, a subquery is generated by using the <xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo> array that is returned from the <xref:System.Type.GetMethods%2A> call. These results are filtered to return only those methods whose return type is an array or else a type that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>. Finally, these results are grouped by using the type name as a key.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
