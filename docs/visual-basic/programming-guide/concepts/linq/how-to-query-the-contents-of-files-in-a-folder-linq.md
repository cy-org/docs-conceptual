# How to: Query the Contents of Files in a Folder (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to query over all the files in a specified directory tree, open each file, and inspect its contents. This type of technique could be used to create indexes or reverse indexes of the contents of a directory tree. A simple string search is performed in this example. However, more complex types of pattern matching can be performed with a regular expression. For more information, see [How to: Combine LINQ Queries with Regular Expressions (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-combine-linq-queries-with-regular-expressions.md).  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Module Module1  
    'QueryContents  
    Public Sub Main()  
  
        ' Modify this path as necessary.  
        Dim startFolder = "c:\program files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VB\"  
  
        'Take a snapshot of the folder contents  
        Dim dir As New System.IO.DirectoryInfo(startFolder)  
        Dim fileList = dir.GetFiles("*.*", System.IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories)  
  
        Dim searchTerm = "Visual Studio"  
  
        ' Search the contents of each file.  
        ' A regular expression created with the RegEx class  
        ' could be used instead of the Contains method.  
        Dim queryMatchingFiles = From file In fileList _  
                                 Where file.Extension = ".htm" _  
                                 Let fileText = GetFileText(file.FullName) _  
                                 Where fileText.Contains(searchTerm) _  
                                 Select file.FullName  
  
        Console.WriteLine("The term " & searchTerm & " was found in:")  
  
        ' Execute the query.  
        For Each filename In queryMatchingFiles  
            Console.WriteLine(filename)  
        Next  
  
        ' Keep the console window open in debug mode.  
        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit")  
        Console.ReadKey()  
  
    End Sub  
  
    ' Read the contents of the file. This is done in a separate  
    ' function in order to handle potential file system errors.  
    Function GetFileText(ByVal name As String) As String  
  
        ' If the file has been deleted, the right thing  
        ' to do in this case is return an empty string.  
        Dim fileContents = String.Empty  
  
        ' If the file has been deleted since we took   
        ' the snapshot, ignore it and return the empty string.  
        If System.IO.File.Exists(name) Then  
            fileContents = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(name)  
        End If  
  
        Return fileContents  
  
    End Function  
End Module  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
