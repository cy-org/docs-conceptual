# How to: Query for Characters in a String (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
Because the <xref:System.String> class implements the generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> interface, any string can be queried as a sequence of characters. However, this is not a common use of LINQ. For complex pattern matching operations, use the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex> class.  
  
## Example  
 The following example queries a string to determine the number of numeric digits it contains. Note that the query is "reused" after it is executed the first time. This is possible because the query itself does not store any actual results.  
  
```vb  
Class QueryAString  
  
    Shared Sub Main()  
  
        ' A string is an IEnumerable data source.  
        Dim aString As String = "ABCDE99F-J74-12-89A"  
  
        ' Select only those characters that are numbers  
        Dim stringQuery = From ch In aString   
                          Where Char.IsDigit(ch)   
                          Select ch  
        ' Execute the query  
        For Each c As Char In stringQuery  
            Console.Write(c & " ")  
        Next  
  
        ' Call the Count method on the existing query.  
        Dim count As Integer = stringQuery.Count()  
        Console.WriteLine(System.Environment.NewLine & "Count = " & count)  
  
        ' Select all characters before the first '-'  
        Dim stringQuery2 = aString.TakeWhile(Function(c) c <> "-")  
  
        ' Execute the second query  
        For Each ch In stringQuery2  
            Console.Write(ch)  
        Next  
  
        Console.WriteLine(System.Environment.NewLine & "Press any key to exit")  
        Console.ReadKey()  
    End Sub  
End Class  
' Output:  
' 9 9 7 4 1 2 8 9   
' Count = 8  
' ABCDE99F  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
