# Enabling a Data Source for LINQ Querying
There are various ways to extend [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] to enable any data source to be queried in the [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] pattern. The data source might be a data structure, a Web service, a file system, or a database, to name some. The [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] pattern makes it easy for clients to query a data source for which [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] querying is enabled, because the syntax and pattern of the query does not change. The ways in which [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] can be extended to these data sources include the following:  
  
-   Implementing the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> interface in a type to enable [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] to Objects querying of that type.  
  
-   Creating standard query operator methods such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A> and <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Select%2A> that extend a type, to enable custom [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] querying of that type.  
  
-   Creating a provider for your data source that implements the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601> interface. A provider that implements this interface receives [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries in the form of expression trees, which it can execute in a custom way, for example remotely.  
  
-   Creating a provider for your data source that takes advantage of an existing [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] technology. Such a provider would enable not only querying, but also insert, update, and delete operations and mapping for user-defined types.  
  
 This topic discusses these options.  
  
## How to Enable LINQ Querying of Your Data Source  
  
### In-Memory Data  
 There are two ways you can enable [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] querying of in-memory data. If the data is of a type that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, you can query the data by using [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] to Objects. If it does not make sense to enable enumeration of your type by implementing the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> interface, you can define [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] standard query operator methods in that type or create [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] standard query operator methods that extend the type. Custom implementations of the standard query operators should use deferred execution to return the results.  
  
### Remote Data  
 The best option for enabling [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] querying of a remote data source is to implement the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601> interface. However, this differs from extending a provider such as [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](~/includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] for a data source. No provider models for extending existing [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] technologies, such as [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](~/includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], to other types of data source are available in [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](~/includes/vs-orcas-long-md.md)].  
  
## IQueryable LINQ Providers  
 [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] providers that implement <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601> can vary widely in their complexity. This section discusses the different levels of complexity.  
  
 A less complex `IQueryable` provider might interface with a single method of a Web service. This type of provider is very specific because it expects specific information in the queries that it handles. It has a closed type system, perhaps exposing a single result type. Most of the execution of the query occurs locally, for example by using the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable> implementations of the standard query operators. A less complex provider might examine only one method call expression in the expression tree that represents the query, and let the remaining logic of the query be handled elsewhere.  
  
 An `IQueryable` provider of medium complexity might target a data source that has a partially expressive query language. If it targets a Web service, it might interface with more than one method of the Web service and select the method to call based on the question that the query poses. A provider of medium complexity would have a richer type system than a simple provider, but it would still be a fixed type system. For example, the provider might expose types that have one-to-many relationships that can be traversed, but it would not provide mapping technology for user-defined types.  
  
 A complex `IQueryable` provider, such as the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](~/includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] provider, might translate complete [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries to an expressive query language, such as SQL. A complex provider is more general than a less complex provider, because it can handle a wider variety of questions in the query. It also has an open type system and therefore must contain extensive infrastructure to map user-defined types. Developing a complex provider requires a significant amount of effort.
