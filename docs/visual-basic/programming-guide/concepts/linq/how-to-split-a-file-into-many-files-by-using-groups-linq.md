# How to: Split a File Into Many Files by Using Groups (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
This example shows one way to merge the contents of two files and then create a set of new files that organize the data in a new way.  
  
### To create the data files  
  
1.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names1.txt and save it in your project folder:  
  
    ```  
    Bankov, Peter  
    Holm, Michael  
    Garcia, Hugo  
    Potra, Cristina  
    Noriega, Fabricio  
    Aw, Kam Foo  
    Beebe, Ann  
    Toyoshima, Tim  
    Guy, Wey Yuan  
    Garcia, Debra  
    ```  
  
2.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names2.txt and save it in your project folder: Note that the two files have some names in common.  
  
    ```  
    Liu, Jinghao  
    Bankov, Peter  
    Holm, Michael  
    Garcia, Hugo  
    Beebe, Ann  
    Gilchrist, Beth  
    Myrcha, Jacek  
    Giakoumakis, Leo  
    McLin, Nkenge  
    El Yassir, Mehdi  
    ```  
  
## Example  
  
```vb  
Class SplitWithGroups  
  
    Shared Sub Main()  
  
        Dim fileA As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("../../../names1.txt")  
        Dim fileB As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("../../../names2.txt")  
  
        ' Concatenate and remove duplicate names based on  
        Dim mergeQuery As IEnumerable(Of String) = fileA.Union(fileB)  
  
        ' Group the names by the first letter in the last name  
        Dim groupQuery = From name In mergeQuery   
                     Let n = name.Split(New Char() {","})   
                     Order By n(0)   
                     Group By groupKey = n(0)(0)   
                     Into groupName = Group  
  
        ' Create a new file for each group that was created  
        ' Note that nested foreach loops are required to access  
        ' individual items with each group.  
        For Each gGroup In groupQuery  
            Dim fileName As String = "..'..'..'testFile_" & gGroup.groupKey & ".txt"  
            Dim sw As New System.IO.StreamWriter(fileName)  
            Console.WriteLine(gGroup.groupKey)  
            For Each item In gGroup.groupName  
                Console.WriteLine("   " & item.name)  
                sw.WriteLine(item.name)  
            Next  
            sw.Close()  
        Next  
  
        ' Keep console window open in debug mode.  
        Console.WriteLine("Files have been written. Press any key to exit.")  
        Console.ReadKey()  
  
    End Sub  
End Class  
' Console Output:  
' A  
'    Aw, Kam Foo  
' B  
'    Bankov, Peter  
'    Beebe, Ann  
' E  
'    El Yassir, Mehdi  
' G  
'    Garcia, Hugo  
'    Garcia, Debra  
'    Giakoumakis, Leo  
'    Gilchrist, Beth  
'    Guy, Wey Yuan  
' H  
'    Holm, Michael  
' L  
'    Liu, Jinghao  
' M  
'    McLin, Nkenge  
'    Myrcha, Jacek  
' N  
'    Noriega, Fabricio  
' P  
'    Potra, Cristina  
' T  
'    Toyoshima, Tim  
```  
  
 The program writes a separate file for each group in the same folder as the data files.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
