# Pre-Atomization of XName Objects (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
One way to improve performance in LINQ to XML is to pre-atomize <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> objects. Pre-atomization means that you assign a string to an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> object before you create the XML tree by using the constructors of the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> and  <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute> classes. Then, instead of passing a string to the constructor, which would use the implicit conversion from string to <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName>, you pass the initialized <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> object.  
  
 This improves performance when you create a large XML tree in which specific names are repeated. To do this, you declare and initialize <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> objects before you construct the XML tree, and then use the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName> objects instead of specifying strings for the element and attribute names. This technique can yield significant performance gains if you are creating a large number of elements (or attributes) with the same name.  
  
 You should test pre-atomization with your scenario to decide if you should use it.  
  
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates this.  
  
```vb  
Dim Root__1 As XName = "Root"  
Dim Data As XName = "Data"  
Dim ID As XName = "ID"  
  
Dim root__2 As New XElement(Root__1, New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, "1"), "4,100,000"), New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, "2"), "3,700,000"), New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, "3"), "1,150,000"))  
  
Console.WriteLine(root__2)  
```  
  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
```xml  
<Root>  
  <Data ID="1">4,100,000</Data>  
  <Data ID="2">3,700,000</Data>  
  <Data ID="3">1,150,000</Data>  
</Root>  
```  
  
 The following example shows the same technique where the XML document is in a namespace:  
  
```vb  
Dim aw As XNamespace = "http://www.adventure-works.com"  
Dim Root__1 As XName = aw + "Root"  
Dim Data As XName = aw + "Data"  
Dim ID As XName = "ID"  
  
Dim root__2 As New XElement(Root__1, New XAttribute(XNamespace.Xmlns + "aw", aw), New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, "1"), "4,100,000"), New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, "2"), "3,700,000"), New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, "3"), "1,150,000"))  
  
Console.WriteLine(root__2)  
```  
  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
```xml  
<aw:Root xmlns:aw="http://www.adventure-works.com">  
  <aw:Data ID="1">4,100,000</aw:Data>  
  <aw:Data ID="2">3,700,000</aw:Data>  
  <aw:Data ID="3">1,150,000</aw:Data>  
</aw:Root>  
```  
  
 The following example is more similar to what you will likely encounter in the real world. In this example, the content of the element is supplied by a query:  
  
```vb  
Dim Root__1 As XName = "Root"  
Dim Data As XName = "Data"  
Dim ID As XName = "ID"  
  
Dim t1 As DateTime = DateTime.Now  
Dim root__2 As New XElement(Root__1, From i In System.Linq.Enumerable.Range(1, 100000)New XElement(Data, New XAttribute(ID, i), i * 5))  
Dim t2 As DateTime = DateTime.Now  
  
Console.WriteLine("Time to construct:{0}", t2 - t1)  
```  
  
 The previous example performs better than the following example, in which names are not pre-atomized:  
  
```vb  
Dim t1 As DateTime = DateTime.Now  
Dim root As New XElement("Root", From i In System.Linq.Enumerable.Range(1, 100000)New XElement("Data", New XAttribute("ID", i), i * 5))  
Dim t2 As DateTime = DateTime.Now  
  
Console.WriteLine("Time to construct:{0}", t2 - t1)  
```
