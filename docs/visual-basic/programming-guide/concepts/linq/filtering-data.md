# Filtering Data (Visual Basic)
Filtering refers to the operation of restricting the result set to contain only those elements that satisfy a specified condition. It is also known as selection.  
  
 The following illustration shows the results of filtering a sequence of characters. The predicate for the filtering operation specifies that the character must be 'A'.  
  
 ![LINQ Filtering Operation](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/media/linq_filter.png "LINQ_Filter")  
  
 The standard query operator methods that perform selection are listed in the following section.  
  
## Methods  
  
|Method Name|Description|Visual Basic Query Expression Syntax|More Information|  
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|  
|OfType|Selects values, depending on their ability to be cast to a specified type.|Not applicable.|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType%2A?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.OfType%2A?displayProperty=fullName>|  
|Where|Selects values that are based on a predicate function.|`Where`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Where%2A?displayProperty=fullName>|  
  
## Query Expression Syntax Example  
 The following example uses the `Where` to filter from an array those strings that have a specific length.  
  
```vb  
Dim words() As String = {"the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}  
  
Dim query = From word In words   
            Where word.Length = 3   
            Select word  
  
Dim sb As New System.Text.StringBuilder()  
For Each str As String In query  
    sb.AppendLine(str)  
Next  
  
' Display the results.  
MsgBox(sb.ToString())  
  
' This code produces the following output:  
  
' the  
' fox  
```
