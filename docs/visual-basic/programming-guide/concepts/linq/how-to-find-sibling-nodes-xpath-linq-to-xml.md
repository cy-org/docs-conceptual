# How to: Find Sibling Nodes (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
You might want to find all siblings of a node that have a specific name. The resulting collection might include the context node if the context node also has the specific name.  
  
 The XPath expression is:  
  
 `../Book`  
  
## Example  
 This example first finds a `Book` element, and then finds all sibling elements named `Book`. The resulting collection includes the context node.  
  
 This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md).  
  
```vb  
Dim books As XDocument = XDocument.Load("Books.xml")  
Dim book As XElement = books.Root.<Book>.Skip(1).First()  
  
' LINQ to XML query  
Dim list1 As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = book.Parent.<Book>  
  
' XPath expression  
Dim list2 As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = book.XPathSelectElements("../Book")  
  
If list1.Count() = list2.Count() And _  
        list1.Intersect(list2).Count() = list1.Count() Then  
    Console.WriteLine("Results are identical")  
Else  
    Console.WriteLine("Results differ")  
End If  
For Each el As XElement In list1  
    Console.WriteLine(el)  
Next  
```  
  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
```  
Results are identical
