# LINQ to XML Axes (Visual Basic)
After you have created an XML tree or loaded an XML document into an XML tree, you can query it to find elements and attributes and retrieve their values.  
  
 Before you can write any queries, you must understand the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] axes. There are two kinds of axis methods: First, there are the methods that you call on a single <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> object, <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> object, or <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode> object. These methods operate on a single object and return a collection of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute>, or <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode> objects. Second, there are extension methods that operate on collections and return collections. The extension methods enumerate the source collection, call the appropriate axis method on each item in the collection, and concatenate the results.
