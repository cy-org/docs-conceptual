# Functional Construction (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] provides a powerful way to create XML elements called *functional construction*. Functional construction is the ability to create an XML tree in a single statement.  
  
 There are several key features of the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] programming interface that enable functional construction:  
  
-   The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> constructor takes various types of arguments for content. For example, you can pass another <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> object, which becomes a child element. You can pass an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute> object, which becomes an attribute of the element. Or you can pass any other type of object, which is converted to a string and becomes the text content of the element.  
  
-   The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> constructor takes a `params` array of type <xref:System.Object>, so that you can pass any number of objects to the constructor. This enables you to create an element that has complex content.  
  
-   If an object implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, the collection in the object is enumerated, and all items in the collection are added. If the collection contains <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> or <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute> objects, each item in the collection is added separately. This is important because it lets you pass the results of a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] query to the constructor.  
  
 The following is an example:  
  
 These features enable you to write code using XML literals to create an XML tree, and also to write code that uses the results of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries when you create an XML tree:  
  
```vb  
Dim srcTree As XElement = _  
    <Root>  
        <Element>1</Element>  
        <Element>2</Element>  
        <Element>3</Element>  
        <Element>4</Element>  
        <Element>5</Element>  
    </Root>  
Dim xmlTree As XElement = _  
    <Root>  
        <Child>1</Child>  
        <Child>2</Child>  
        <%= From el In srcTree.Elements() _  
            Where CInt(el) > 2 _  
            Select el %>  
    </Root>  
Console.WriteLine(xmlTree)  
```  
  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
```xml  
<Root>  
  <Child>1</Child>  
  <Child>2</Child>  
  <Element>3</Element>  
  <Element>4</Element>  
  <Element>5</Element>  
</Root>  
```
