# Advanced LINQ to XML Programming (Visual Basic)
This section provides information that will only be applicable to advanced developers in certain [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] scenarios.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[LINQ to XML Annotations](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-annotations.md)|Describes how to add annotations to [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] nodes and attributes.|  
|[LINQ to XML Events (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-events.md)|Describes how to write event handlers for events that occur when you alter an XML tree.|  
|[Programming with Nodes (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/programming-with-nodes.md)|Describes how to query and manipulate nodes at a finer level of granularity than elements and attributes.|  
|[Mixed Declarative Code/Imperative Code Bugs (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/mixed-declarative-code-imperative-code-bugs-linq-to-xml.md)|Describes the problems that appear when you mix declarative code (queries) with imperative code (code that modifies the XML tree).|  
|[How to: Stream XML Fragments with Access to Header Information (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-stream-xml-fragments-with-access-to-header-information.md)|Describes how to stream XML fragments from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. You can use this technique to control the memory footprint of your application.|  
|[How to: Perform Streaming Transform of Large XML Documents (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-perform-streaming-transform-of-large-xml-documents.md)|Describes how to stream XML from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, transform the XML fragment, and stream the output using <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XStreamingElement>.|  
|[How to: Read and Write an Encoded Document (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-read-and-write-an-encoded-document.md)|Describes how to read and write XML documents that are encoded.|  
|[Using XSLT to Transform an XML Tree (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/using-xslt-to-transform-an-xml-tree.md)|Describes how to transform an XML tree using XSLT.|  
|[How to: Use Annotations to Transform LINQ to XML Trees in an XSLT Style (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-use-annotation-trees-to-transform-linq-to-xml-trees-in-an-xslt-style.md)|Describes how annotations can be used to facilitate transforms of an XML tree.|  
|[Serializing Object Graphs that Contain XElement Objects (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/serializing-object-graphs-that-contain-xelement-objects.md)|Describes how to serialize object graphs that contain <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> objects.|  
|[WPF Data Binding with LINQ to XML](/visualstudio/designers/wpf-data-binding-with-linq-to-xml)|Describes how to use LINQ to XML as the data source for data binding in Windows Presentation Foundation applications.|
