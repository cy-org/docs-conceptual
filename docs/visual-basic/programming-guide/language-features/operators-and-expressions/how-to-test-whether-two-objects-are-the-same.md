# How to: Test Whether Two Objects Are the Same (Visual Basic)
If you have two variables that refer to objects, you can use either the `Is` or `IsNot` operator, or both, to determine whether they refer to the same instance.  
  
### To test whether two objects are the same  
  
-   Use the [Is Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md) or the [IsNot Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md) with the two variables as operands.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#69](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-test-whether-two-objects-are-the-same_1.vb)]  
  
 You might want to take a certain action depending on whether two objects refer to the same instance. The preceding example compares control `c` against the active control on form `f`. If there is no active control, or if there is one but it is not the same control instance as `c`, then the `If` statement fails and the procedure returns without further processing.  
  
 Whether you use `Is` or `IsNot` is a matter of personal convenience to you. One might be easier to read than the other in a given expression.
