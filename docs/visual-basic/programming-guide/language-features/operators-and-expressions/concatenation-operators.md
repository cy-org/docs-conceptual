# Concatenation Operators in Visual Basic
Concatenation operators join multiple strings into a single string. There are two concatenation operators, `+` and `&`. Both carry out the basic concatenation operation, as the following example shows.  
  
```vb
Dim x As String = "Mic" & "ro" & "soft" 
Dim y As String = "Mic" + "ro" + "soft" 
' The preceding statements set both x and y to "Microsoft".
```  
  
 These operators can also concatenate `String` variables, as the following example shows.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#76](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/concatenation-operators_1.vb)]  
  
## Differences Between the Two Concatenation Operators  
 The [+ Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addition-operator.md) has the primary purpose of adding two numbers. However, it can also concatenate numeric operands with string operands. The `+` operator has a complex set of rules that determine whether to add, concatenate, signal a compiler error, or throw a run-time <xref:System.InvalidCastException> exception.  
  
 The [& Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/concatenation-operator.md) is defined only for `String` operands, and it always widens its operands to `String`, regardless of the setting of `Option Strict`. The `&` operator is recommended for string concatenation because it is defined exclusively for strings and reduces your chances of generating an unintended conversion.  
  
## Performance: String and StringBuilder  
 If you do a significant number of manipulations on a string, such as concatenations, deletions, and replacements, your performance might profit from the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> class in the <xref:System.Text> namespace. It takes an extra instruction to create and initialize a <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> object, and another instruction to convert its final value to a `String`, but you might recover this time because <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> can perform faster.
