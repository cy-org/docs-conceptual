# LINQ in Visual Basic
This section contains overviews, examples, and background information that will help you understand and use Visual Basic and [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](~/includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)  
 Provides an introduction to [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] providers, operators, query structure, and language features.  
  
 [How to: Query a Database](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-query-a-database-by-using-linq.md)  
 Provides an example of how to connect to a SQL Server database and execute a query by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Call a Stored Procedure](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-call-a-stored-procedure-by-using-linq.md)  
 Provides an example of how to connect to a SQL Server database and call a stored procedure by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Modify Data in a Database](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-modify-data-in-a-database-by-using-linq.md)  
 Provides an example of how to connect to a SQL Server database and retrieve and modify data by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Combine Data with Joins](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-combine-data-with-linq-by-using-joins.md)  
 Provides examples of how to join data in a manner similar to database joins by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Sort Query Results](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-sort-query-results-by-using-linq.md)  
 Provides an example of how to order the results of a query by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Filter Query Results](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-filter-query-results-by-using-linq.md)  
 Provides an example of how to include search criteria in a query by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Count, Sum, or Average Data](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-count-sum-or-average-data-by-using-linq.md)  
 Provides examples of how to include aggregate functions to Count, Sum, or Average data returned from a query by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Find the Minimum or Maximum Value in a Query Result](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-find-the-minimum-or-maximum-value-in-a-query-result.md)  
 Provides examples of how to include aggregate functions to determine the minimum and maximum values of data returned from a query by using LINQ.  
  
 [How to: Return a LINQ Query Result as a Specific Type](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-return-a-linq-query-result-as-a-specific-type.md)  
 Provides an example of how to return the results of a LINQ query as a specific type instead of as an anonymous type.
