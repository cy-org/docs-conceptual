# Troubleshooting Inherited Event Handlers in Visual Basic
This topic lists common issues that arise with event handlers in inherited components.  
  
## Procedures  
  
#### Code in Event Handler Executes Twice for Every Call  
  
-   An inherited event handler must not include a [Handles](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/handles-clause.md) clause. The method in the base class is already associated with the event and will fire accordingly. Remove the `Handles` clause from the inherited method.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrEvents#32](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/codesnippet/VisualBasic/troubleshooting-inherited-event-handlers_1.vb)]  
  
-   If the inherited method does not have a `Handles` keyword, verify that your code does not contain an extra [AddHandler Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/addhandler-statement.md) or any additional methods that handle the same event.
