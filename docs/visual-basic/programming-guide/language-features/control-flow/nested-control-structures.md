# Nested Control Structures (Visual Basic)
You can place control statements inside other control statements, for example an `If...Then...Else` block within a `For...Next` loop. A control statement placed inside another control statement is said to be *nested*.  
  
## Nesting Levels  
 Control structures in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] can be nested to as many levels as you want. It is common practice to make nested structures more readable by indenting the body of each one. The integrated development environment (IDE) editor automatically does this.  
  
 In the following example, the procedure `sumRows` adds together the positive elements of each row of the matrix.  
  
```  
Public Sub sumRows(ByVal a(,) As Double, ByRef r() As Double)  
    Dim i, j As Integer  
    For i = 0 To UBound(a, 1)  
        r(i) = 0  
        For j = 0 To UBound(a, 2)  
            If a(i, j) > 0 Then  
                r(i) = r(i) + a(i, j)  
            End If  
        Next j  
    Next i  
End Sub  
```  
  
 In the preceding example, the first `Next` statement closes the inner `For` loop and the last `Next` statement closes the outer `For` loop.  
  
 Likewise, in nested `If` statements, the `End If` statements automatically apply to the nearest prior `If` statement. Nested `Do` loops work in a similar fashion, with the innermost `Loop` statement matching the innermost `Do` statement.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For many control structures, when you click a keyword, all of the keywords in the structure are highlighted. For instance, when you click `If` in an `If...Then...Else` construction, all instances of `If`, `Then`, `ElseIf`, `Else`, and `End If` in the construction are highlighted. To move to the next or previous highlighted keyword, press CTRL+SHIFT+DOWN ARROW or CTRL+SHIFT+UP ARROW.  
  
## Nesting Different Kinds of Control Structures  
 You can nest one kind of control structure within another kind. The following example uses a `With` block inside a `For Each` loop and nested `If` blocks inside the `With` block.  
  
```  
For Each ctl As System.Windows.Forms.Control In Me.Controls  
    With ctl  
        .BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.Yellow  
        .ForeColor = System.Drawing.Color.Black  
        If .CanFocus Then  
            .Text = "Colors changed"  
            If Not .Focus() Then  
                ' Insert code to process failed focus.  
            End If  
        End If  
    End With  
Next ctl  
```  
  
## Overlapping Control Structures  
 You cannot overlap control structures. This means that any nested structure must be completely contained within the next innermost structure. For example, the following arrangement is invalid because the `For` loop terminates before the inner `With` block terminates.

 The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] compiler detects such overlapping control structures and signals a compile-time error.
