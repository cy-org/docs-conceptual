# How to: Determine Whether Two Objects Are Related (Visual Basic)
You can compare two objects to determine the relationship, if any, between the classes from which they are created. The <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> method of the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> class returns `True` if the specified class inherits from the current class, or if the current type is an interface supported by the specified class.  
  
### To determine if one object inherits from another object's class or interface  
  
1.  On the object you think might be of the base type, invoke the <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A> method.  
  
2.  On the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> object returned by <xref:System.Object.GetType%2A>, invoke the <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> method.  
  
3.  In the argument list for <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A>, specify the object you think might be of the derived type.  
  
     <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> returns `True` if its argument type inherits from the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> object type.  
  
## Example  
 The following example determines whether one object represents a class derived from another object's class.  
  
```  
Public Class baseClass  
End Class  
Public Class derivedClass : Inherits baseClass  
End Class  
Public Class testTheseClasses  
    Public Sub seeIfRelated()  
        Dim baseObj As Object = New baseClass()  
        Dim derivedObj As Object = New derivedClass()  
        Dim related As Boolean  
        related = baseObj.GetType().IsInstanceOfType(derivedObj)  
        MsgBox(CStr(related))  
    End Sub  
End Class  
```  
  
 Note the unexpected placement of the two object variables in the call to <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A>. The supposed base type is used to generate the <xref:System.Type?displayProperty=fullName> class, and the supposed derived type is passed as an argument to the <xref:System.Type.IsInstanceOfType%2A> method.
