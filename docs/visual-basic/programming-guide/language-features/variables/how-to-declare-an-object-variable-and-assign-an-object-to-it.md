# How to: Declare an Object Variable and Assign an Object to It in Visual Basic
You declare a variable of the [Object Data Type](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md) by specifying `As Object` in a [Dim Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md). You assign an object to such a variable by placing the object after the equal sign (`=`) in an assignment statement or initialization clause.  
  
## Example  
 The following example declares an `Object` variable and assigns the current instance to it.  
  
```  
      Dim thisObject As Object  
thisObject = "This is an Object"  
```  
  
 You can combine the declaration and assignment by initializing the variable as part of its declaration. The following example is equivalent to the preceding example.  
  
```  
Dim thisObject As Object= "This is an Object"  
```  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
-   A reference to the <xref:System> namespace.  
  
-   A class, structure, or module in which to put the `Dim` statement.  
  
-   A procedure in which to put the assignment statement.
