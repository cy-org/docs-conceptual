# How to: Move Data Into and Out of a Variable (Visual Basic)
You store a value in a variable by putting the variable name on the left side of an assignment statement.  
  
## Putting Data in a Variable  
  
#### To store a value in a variable  
  
-   Use the variable name on the left side of an assignment statement.  
  
     The following example sets the value of the variable `alpha`.  
  
    ```  
    alpha = (beta * 6.27) / (gamma + 2.1)  
    ```  
  
     The value generated on the right side of the assignment statement is stored in the variable.  
  
## Getting Data from a Variable  
 You retrieve a variable's value by including the variable name in an expression.  
  
#### To retrieve a value from a variable  
  
-   Use the variable name in an expression. You can use a variable anywhere you can use a constant or a literal, except in an expression that defines the value of a constant.  
  
     -or-  
  
-   Use the variable name following the equal (`=`) sign in an assignment statement.  
  
     The following example reads the value of the variable `startValue` and then uses the value of the variable `counter` in an expression.  
  
    ```  
    counter = startValue  
    cellValue = (counter + 5) ^ 2  
    ```  
  
     The value of the variable participates in the expression just as a constant would, and then it is stored in the variable or property on the left side of the assignment statement.
