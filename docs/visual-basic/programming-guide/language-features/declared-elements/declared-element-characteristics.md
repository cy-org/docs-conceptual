# Declared Element Characteristics (Visual Basic)
A *characteristic* of a declared element is an aspect of that element that affects how code can interact with it. Every declared element has one or more of the following characteristics associated with it:  
  
-   *Data type* — the values the element can hold, and how it stores those values. For more information, see [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/data-type-summary.md).  
  
-   *Lifetime* — the period of execution time during which the element is available for use. For more information, see [Lifetime in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/lifetime.md).  
  
-   *Scope* — the set of all code that can refer to the element without qualifying its name. For more information, see [How to: Control the Scope of a Variable](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/how-to-control-the-scope-of-a-variable.md).  
  
-   *Access level* — the permission for code to make use of the element. For more information, see [How to: Control the Availability of a Variable](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/how-to-control-the-availability-of-a-variable.md).  
  
## Characteristics of the Elements  
 The following table shows the declared elements and the characteristics that apply to each one.  
  
|Element|Data Type|Lifetime|Scope <sup>1</sup>|Access Level|  
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------|  
|Variable|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|Constant|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Enumeration|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Structure|No|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Property|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|Method|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|Procedure (`Sub` or `Function`)|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|  
|Procedure parameter|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|  
|Function return|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|  
|Operator|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Interface|No|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Class|No|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Event|No|No|Yes|Yes|  
|Delegate|No|No|Yes|Yes|  
  
 <sup>1</sup> Scope is sometimes referred to as *visibility*.
