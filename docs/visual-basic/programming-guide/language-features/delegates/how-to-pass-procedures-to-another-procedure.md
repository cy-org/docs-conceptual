# How to: Pass Procedures to Another Procedure in Visual Basic
This example shows how to use delegates to pass a procedure to another procedure.  
  
 A delegate is a type that you can use like any other type in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)]. The `AddressOf` operator returns a delegate object when applied to a procedure name.  
  
 This example has a procedure with a delegate parameter that can take a reference to another procedure, obtained with the `AddressOf` operator.  
  
### Create the delegate and matching procedures  
  
1.  Create a delegate named `MathOperator`.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#1](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_1.vb)]  
  
2.  Create a procedure named `AddNumbers` with parameters and return value that match those of `MathOperator`, so that the signatures match.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#2](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_2.vb)]  
  
3.  Create a procedure named `SubtractNumbers` with a signature that matches `MathOperator`.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#3](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_3.vb)]  
  
4.  Create a procedure named `DelegateTest` that takes a delegate as a parameter.  
  
     This procedure can accept a reference to `AddNumbers` or `SubtractNumbers`, because their signatures match the `MathOperator` signature.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#4](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_4.vb)]  
  
5.  Create a procedure named `Test` that calls `DelegateTest` once with the delegate for `AddNumbers` as a parameter, and again with the delegate for `SubtractNumbers` as a parameter.  
  
     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#5](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_5.vb)]  
  
     When `Test` is called, it first displays the result of `AddNumbers` acting on `5` and `3`, which is 8. Then the result of `SubtractNumbers` acting on `9` and `3` is displayed, which is 6.
