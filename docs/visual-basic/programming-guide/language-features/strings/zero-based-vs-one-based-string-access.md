# Zero-based vs. One-based String Access in Visual Basic
This topic compares how [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] provide access to the characters in a string. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] always provides zero-based access to the characters in a string, whereas [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] provides zero-based and one-based access, depending on the function.  
  
## One-Based  
 For an example of a one-based [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] function, consider the `Mid` function. It takes an argument that indicates the character position at which the substring will start, starting with position 1. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] <xref:System.String.Substring%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method takes an index of the character in the string at which the substring is to start, starting with position 0. Thus, if you have a string "ABCDE", the individual characters are numbered 1,2,3,4,5 for use with the `Mid` function, but 0,1,2,3,4 for use with the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  
  
## Zero-Based  
 For an example of a zero-based [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] function, consider the `Split` function. It splits a string and returns an array containing the substrings. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] <xref:System.String.Split%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method also splits a string and returns an array containing the substrings. Because the `Split` function and <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method return [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] arrays, they must be zero-based.
