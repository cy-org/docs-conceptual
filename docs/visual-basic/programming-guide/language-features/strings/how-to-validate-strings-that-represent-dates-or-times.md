# How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)
The following code example sets a `Boolean` value that indicates whether a string represents a valid date or time.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnRegEx#2](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-validate-strings-that-represent-dates-or-times_1.vb)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Replace `("01/01/03")` and `"9:30 PM"` with the date and time you want to validate. You can replace the string with another hard-coded string, with a `String` variable, or with a method that returns a string, such as `InputBox`.  
  
## Robust Programming  
 Use this method to validate the string before trying to convert the `String` to a `DateTime` variable. By checking the date or time first, you can avoid generating an exception at run time.
