# How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic
This example returns a `Boolean` value that indicates whether a string represents a file name or path. The validation checks if the name contains characters that are not allowed by the file system.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnRegEx#4](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-validate-file-names-and-paths_1.vb)]  
  
 This example does not check if the name has incorrectly placed colons, or directories with no name, or if the length of the name exceeds the system-defined maximum length. It also does not check if the application has permission to access the file-system resource with the specified name.
