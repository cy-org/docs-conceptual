### ResolveAssemblyReference task now warns of dependencies with the wrong architecture

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Details|The task emits a warning, MSB3270, which indicates that a reference or any of its dependencies does not match the app&#39;s architecture. For example, this occurs if an app that was compiled with the <code>AnyCPU</code> option includes an x86 reference. Such a scenario could result in an app failure at run time (in this case, if the app is deployed as an x64 process).|
|Suggestion|There are two areas of impact:<ul><li>Recompilation generates warnings that did not appear when the app was compiled under a previous version of MSBuild. However, because the warning identifies a possible source of runtime failure, it should be investigated and addressed.</li><li>If warnings are treated as errors, the app will fail to compile.</li></ul>|
