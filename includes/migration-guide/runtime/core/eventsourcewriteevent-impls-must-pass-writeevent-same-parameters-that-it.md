### EventSource.WriteEvent impls must pass WriteEvent the same parameters that it received (plus ID)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Details|The runtime now enforces the contract that specifies the following: A class derived from <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource?displayProperty=name> that defines an ETW event method must call the base class <code>EventSource.WriteEvent</code> method with the event ID followed by the same arguments that the ETW event method was passed.|
|Suggestion|An <xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException?displayProperty=name> exception is thrown if an <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventListener?displayProperty=name> reads <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource?displayProperty=name> data in process for an event source that violates this contract.|
