### WPF windows are rendered without clipping when extending outside a single monitor

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Details|In the .NET Framework 4.6 running on Windows 8 and above, the entire window is rendered without clipping when it extends outside of single display in a multi-monitor scenario. This is different from previous versions of the .NET Framework which would clip WPF windows that extended beyond a single display.|
|Suggestion|This behavior (whether to clip or not) can be explicitly set using the <code>&lt;EnableMultiMonitorDisplayClipping&gt;</code> element in <code>&lt;appSettings&gt;</code> in an application&#39;s configuration file, or by setting the <code>EnableMultiMonitorDisplayClipping</code> property at app startup.|
|Scope|Minor|
|Version|4.6|
|Type|Runtime|
