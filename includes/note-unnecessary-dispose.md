> [!NOTE]
> This type implements the @System.IDisposable interface, but does not actually have any resources to dispose. This means that disposing it by directly calling @System.IDisposable.Dispose or by using a language construct such as `using` (in C#) or `Using` (in Visual Basic) is not necessary.
